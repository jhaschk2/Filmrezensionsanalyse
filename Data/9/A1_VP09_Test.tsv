ID_100241	"The whole film was just dull and adopted too many elements of modern Hollywood. Far too many key events and plot complications were disappointingly familiar. Important characters have little motivation to carry out key plot progress and I kept asking myself ""why does this person even care?""Storm troopers were more incompetent than ever and felt even more disposable than zombies. The off-screen characters were disposable on the same scale as what's typical of a superhero or apocalypse film. As is typical of those genres, viewers of The Force Awakens are led to believe that for some reason, the protagonists are the only ones who can save the day, even though there could in fact be other groups that could get involved if they so desired.There was more humour than in previous films, but much of it was low-brow and equivalent to slapstick, with the punchline being based on various people being stupid. Curiously, I found myself sometimes laughing a sentence before the rest of the theatre patrons, all Americans.I found the new black male protagonist to be about as likable as the brat from Spirited Away. I didn't especially like the new white female protagonist either."
ID_100242	"JJ Abrams is smart about how he plays with the toys he was given. If I had one criticism about this movie; it's to be too classic in its structure - no spoiler but the movie will feel very familiar. On the other hand, what is the right balance to strike between old & new? There is new in this movie - lots of it. The new characters are strong and different from their elders. The settings are cool, the Star Wars technology and designs amazing (there will be so many new toys from this movie!)But Abrams manages to weave the old in ways that please and bring a smile to the hardcore fans. That was very well done. And the end scene is amazing and poignant. I need to probably re-watch it but day 1, first screening I left happy to have spent two new hours in the much beloved Star Wars Universe - I guess this is what matters."
ID_100243	Episode 7 has redeemed a franchise that for many hardcore traditional fans had become a niggling source of disappointment.This is everything that 1, 2 & 3 weren't. The acting is solid - something we've never really associated with the franchise. The music is not clichéd - there are some new themes which will most likely catch on. The storyline is coherent and promises longevity and the action is gripping. From the opening scene you realize that 32 years after Return of the Jedi and the utter disappointment of 1, 2 & 3, Star Wars fans are finally in for a treat. It is a return to what worked,The directing is solid as is the dialogue, in fact probably the best dialogue in all seven films.
ID_100244	First of all, I will say this movie is great fun. Abrams does a great job with the action scenes and the pace is great. Rey is perhaps the greatest character in the series so far, I thought she was even better than Han Solo. Also I think Kylo Ren is a great character.So yes, the movie is a great experience and absolutely worth seeing, but there are a lot of problems, the major one being how familiar it is. From the first scene of the film, beats and plot points feel extremely familiar to the OT. The movie tries so hard to be the originals that it never really establishes anything new. People accusing it of being a remake are not as far off as I would like to say. I was also disappointed with the character of Finn, Boyega does a great job, but his character is a bit all over the place and extremely underdeveloped. Felt almost more like comic relief than anything which is a shame as he is almost a lead character. That's all I will say, there are more flaws, but they generally involve plot points and spoilers. Still, it is great fun, go see it in Imax.
ID_100245	"Good heaven's i don't know where to start. I've been watching star wars since i was four years old. I was a fan of it and then i grew out of it but the fonder memories never left me. I always loved the previous six films and kept recommending it to my non movie watching wife and my little daughter. They were so amazing, ""Empire strikes back"" name just makes me run back to my TV to see whats it all about.But this is a catastrophe. Whoever is responsible for doing this movie had done the greatest crime in movie history by destroying one of the best loved films of all time. What in the world he / she / they were thinking? why did star wars had to go down this way?A complete utter disaster (IMO), and i felt that acting of the new comers were pretty stupid, and childish. I am no professional but i remember the star wars episode 1 when Natalie portman played her role, that was brilliant (IMO). but this is just a plain disaster. I don't know if something is wrong with me or something is really wrong with the movie but from top to bottom i'd give it ZERO if it weren't for seeing old crew like SOLO and Millennium Falcon.I know some might say they are passing the torch... well you can pass torches in a much better way than this. If Disney or JJ abraham who ever that is responsible for this.... this is utter crap. Stop ruining LEGENDARY MOVIES... DO YOUR OWN THINGS"
ID_100246	"Since the arrival of J.J Abrams to the star wars saga, it was clear that some; if not a lot was going to change.This change has been much unapreciated in the IMDb community, spawning a great number of negative reviews, calling it a remake rather than a sequel, however; this is not the case: the shared plotpoints and familiar themes from the original star wars trilogy are there to appeal to old star wars fans seeking a renassaince in the star wars saga after the disappointment of the prequels.J.J Abrams not only fooled most of the speculating media (example: Luke= Kylo Ren theory) but also gave us one of the best installments in the saga. Before you prepare your keyboards to make an immediate counterpoint, let me explain: ""The force awakens"" isn't anything incredibly new but rather refreshing, it bought a new approach at action sequences: awesome X-Wing piloting sequences, Dirty lightsaber fights and more blaster action (""nothing beats a good blaster at your side,kid"" -Han Solo). It gave us realistic and likable characters: Poe Dameron is a synonym of likable, Kylo Ren is a vulnerable human being under the mask; unlike darth vader and the emperor, and many beloved characters make a heartwarming return to the saga.The force awakens is innovative, but returns to the roots of the saga, taking out many ideas and themes from a new hope, empire strikes back and even return of the jedi. It's a breath of fresh air in the sci- fi and action department, a much needed one. Star wars: The force awakens is one of the best sci-fi/action flicks of 2015 and I hope to see more Star wars soon."
ID_100247	"As a huge Star Wars fan from a young age, writing an objective review of this movie is almost impossible. It's evident from the reviews here on IMDb that people are either adoring this movie, or they're vastly disappointed by it. Like most other fans, I was thrilled to hear this movie announced and even more thrilled that George Lucas would no longer be involved. I do not appreciate the prequel movies and had high hopes for this movie, considering the new team behind it.Considering the disappointed responses from some fans, I believe I fall in the category of people that can really appreciate this movie for what it is, which is a good old fashioned Star Wars movie. It's got some flaws, but, in my opinion, there is far more to love than there is to hate.You've got to commend JJ Abrams and his team for the work they've put in. It's almost like they were consciously trying to mend some of the ""hurt"" the prequels caused in this aspect: the sets, the puppets, the effects are all overwhelmingly present, in a good way. That hated plastic, artificial feel from the prequels is gone.The fun doesn't stop there. The actors did a solid job, too. Whether it's the newcomers (whom you fear might not be up to the task) or the oldies (whom you fear might just be doing it for the heck of it) I wasn't once distracted by their acting, which means they're doing a fine job of it.I enjoyed the new characters and I feel the existing characters were done justice by their parts.Without revealing anything about the plot, suffice to say it's not the most original of plots. That being said, there is still enough to leave you wondering and a couple of surprises in there. In short, I don't really get the hate, even if the overall plot is probably the movie's weakest point.All in all, I feel this movie has redeemed Star Wars and put it back in its proper place. I will absolutely be seeing it again once it's been released on BluRay and I can't wait to show it to my kids in a few years.Go see it, I'm pretty sure you'll love it!"
ID_100248	Let me ask you this, after you watched Return of the Jedi...way back when...were you hoping that there would be another SEQUEL? A bunch of us did, but George Lucas gave us PREQUELS. Now don't get me wrong, the prequels have their flaws but do add to more depth to the Star Wars universe and got better towards the end. But The Force Awakens continues the legendary tale forward. We all wondered what might have happened after the empire was defeated...well now we know--sort of--I'm sure more will be revealed in the next sequel. But right now this movie is IT! This is the Star Wars sequel we've been waiting for! Less fancy CGI than the prequels, more action and even some comedy, and a good balance of nostalgia combined with the additon of new characters and moving the story forward. This movie respects the fans of the old Star Wars while forging ahead to create more new fans. It's awesome, best movie this Christmas season...so don't just sit there reading reviews...GO AND SEE IT!
ID_100249	The legendary epic saga continues as Star Wars returns with a new entry properly called The Force Awakens. Picking up three decades after Return of the Jedi even after the defeat of the Galactic empire a new threat is on the horizon as the darkness still is present in many forms. A young Sith lord has come to control much of the galaxy as that's the evil and mysterious Kylo Ren(Adam Driver in a strong performance)and the film would reveal a troubled family secret that's attached to Ren. And from the planet of Jakku a young lady named Rey(newcomer Daisy Ridley) a slave type scavenger who comes upon the scene to help the rebels once she exits her planet as this lady is a Jedi in the making. Finn(John Boyega is a storm trooper who takes a turn for the good to help fight evil in the galaxy. And in a real treat the return of old characters is abound with Han Solo and Princess Leia and the fury fuzzball who I say is Bigfoot's brother and that's Chewbacca all make a return! Overall it's a joy and thrill ride of space battles with ships and explosions and battles of good facing evil and the saga has mixed connections of characters new and old from the saga to strongly awaken the force and fly high thru the galaxy!
ID_100250	"Mixed feelings on this one. Again the hype machine set my expectations way too high. The trailers were brilliant. When I see trailers that good, my mind starts to imagine what to expect from the plot, I just cant help it. When the picture in my head matches what I see on the screen, I view that as predictable and relatively enjoyable (if made well), when on the other hand a movie exceeds my imagination, I hail that movie as something amazing. This ones a mixed bag, but fundamentally the story elements and characters are not very well written, rushed in some areas and overwritten in others, the balance is wrong if you pardon the pun. I just didn't care for the wonderfully directed action scenes and didn't emotionally connect with the main protagonists. The Star Wars universe is wonderfully created here and seeing Han,Leia etc on the big screen is a great tick in the box but therein lies the problem, it serves to be a tick in the box; the whole thing just feels a bit forced. George Lucus got a bashing for the prequels, but thats because he's not a great Director of actors, but he a great story writer - the prequels though badly executed, were actually good stories. Fortunately the force awakens doesn't suffer some of the cringe worthy moments present in the prequels but the story is one that you've seen before. Being cynical then this is just another franchise and as such is just a precursor or advertisement if you like for all the memorabilia that will be available for the kids to enjoy. Go see it but be sure to dumb down your expectations."
ID_100251	I entered the cinema complex with absolute no knowledge about the movie, the only thing I saw was one trailer, that's it. Even if you did watch all of the trailers, shots,... you can't know what will happen to you in the following 2hours and 15 minutes...First of all, the actors are really good, there's a fantastic dynamic between old and new characters. Second, there's a fantastic mix of different things happening. You have, obviously, the action. But besides that the movie also tries (and succeeds) to give you a deeper look in the emotions of the characters. Third, plot twists, plot twists plot twists.I think it is safe to say that this movie will go down as one of the best in the franchise. The director really does live up to the expectations!!
ID_100252	It's basically just a rehash of seven scenes and story lines from the first three films ... Put together with good cgi but apparently no decent writers ... Cliché upon cliché flashes across the screen colourfully ... A load of really dull characters do the sort of things you'd expect ... The villain is a bit of a wimpy dullard ... The original cast show up for a laugh ... But really there is certainly nothing new or interesting in this ... And quite frankly, in the age of Guardians of the Galaxy, this is outmoded in every way from the outset ... Mediocre film making that feeds on geek love of the first three films ... Unfortunately these are different times and this has none of the charm or excitement of the unique original trilogy
ID_100253	Why Star Wars A New Hope was better than The Force Awakens.At the end of Star Wars Luke turns OFF his targeting computer with the encouragement of Obi Wan Kenobi from the spirit world. He uses his the FORCE instead, his INTUITION, and overcomes his families dark legacy. But only with the help of a friend/Han Solo who risked his life to save his friend beyond mere monetary reward. - good spiritual growth in the movie...which comes to a celebratory conclusion.In The Force Awakens, nobody destroys their families dark legacy by using their INTUITION (AWAKENED SELF) over machinery and tech - it was just a bunch of shooting at stuff. And the love that Han and Leia shared was rewarded with death and darkness.But i suppose that kind of story would emerge from a corporation that BOUGHT the story for financial gain, as opposed to creating a story for all to be AWAKENED by.
ID_100254	"Positives:
Negatives:"
ID_100255	30 years ago the incredible Star Wars trilogy came to an end, many didn't expect the return of the characters we grew to love and cherish, but now they have returned and JJ Abrams has given us back a world which shaped so many childhoods and i could not be happier. This review will be completely spoiler-free, which will be hard with so much to cover, but i will not be revealing anything here which you didn't already know from trailers.A very basic story outline is that we follow Rey and Finn, two characters who are quite similar in many ways, but who are so interesting to get to know. I won't be revealing anything else because if i do i will literally be treading into spoiler territory. First things first though, Harrison Ford as Han Solo. My god. Han Solo is my favourite character in the entire Star Wars saga. Harrison Ford does such a good job at bringing this character back that he alone shows us why we missed this universe so much. He wasn't shoehorned in either. He played a vital part in the plot and did the best job possible. I loved seeing him and Chewbacca, who was hilarious in this film, step onto the Millennium Falcon for the first time. When the opening title crawl came onto the screen with the iconic John Williams theme playing through the IMAX speaker system my heart swelled with nostalgia and my eyes filled with tears. This was a moment i never expected to see and it could not have been done in a better way. The same goes for Han and Chewie stepping onto the falcon. It was just that good.That being said, the main cast of newcomers were incredible. John Boyega's Finn is such a relatable character who has done wrong and just wants to right that and Oscar Issac as Poe was just the most likable guy ever. But my favourite character in the entire film was Rey. I love Daisy Ridley, she is such a likable person and I had every faith that she would make this role her own and completely shine in this film.. which she did. Getting to know Rey as a character turned out to be the most interesting part of this film for me, which is saying a lot because A LOT happens. As well as this we have our new 'Empire' who are known as the First Order. Adam Driver as Kylo Ren was also such a joy to watch. He didn't just play this bad character who was bad for the sake of it. He had real human emotion. He played the character as someone who was fearful and had a sort of emotional vibe which set him apart from other villains in the saga. I was however disappointed by the lack of anything Captain Phasma does in this film.. she is literally the new Boba Fett. Im not saying that is a bad thing, i was just expecting her to do more.I saw this film in IMAX. The locations and set design are stunning. There is a scene where Rey is introduced on Jakku and we see the area, it is so well shot that i felt there and was literally amazed by what i was seeing. I also like the high use of Practical effects. Almost every character we see is practical, whereas others who are CGI such as Maz Kanata (motion capture) look so real that they don't feel out of place. But a lot of praise for going back to the original route of using mostly practical effects. A lot of people say this is too similar to the original Star Wars film, whilst the last act is pretty similar, this film did feel like its own film at the same time. Some characters such as C3PO and R2D2 feel kind of like if they weren't there it wouldn't make a difference, but like i said new characters really feel at home here. BB8 had a lot of great moments which were real highlights of the film, he also played a huge part in the plot of this film which surprised me.But all-in-all what can i say except, thank you JJ Abrams. This film makes us realise why we missed this universe so damn much. From seeing the Falcon take flight for the first time, to seeing Han and Leia reunite for the first time, it warmed my heart as a huge Star Wars fan and i smiled almost the whole time in this film. There are a few real emotionally heart wrenching scenes too though. I laughed, i cried and having the franchise in the hands of newcomers Daisy Ridley and John Boyega as well as Oscar Isaac, well i am just okay with that. They have bright careers ahead of them and they have really proved themselves. This is the best in the saga since The Empire Strikes Back and i cant wait to see where this story is heading, as well as seeing this film again. May the force be with you
ID_100256	"Rey, a scavenger barely eking out a living, needs to go home. She will do what she can to support the resistance, but she needs to come back to her planet. Nothing remains there for her but a hope that something or someone will find her.Fate decides otherwise. A force, maybe even ""the force,"" compels her otherwise to abandon home. Her awakening, though not completed by film's end, is what makes this film a triumph. And the cliff-hanger ending leaves you puzzled, yet satisfied that there are more revelations ahead. While you might think you have the answers, do not be surprised if you're surprised by next installment.Some have said that this episode is a reboot of ""A New Hope."" On the surface that might be a fair comment, but it seems to miss the point.Rey wanted to stay home-bound, hoping ""something"" or ""someone"" would find her. Away from home, she is now in a galaxy so very far, far away . . . .Now, so far away, has she found what she lost so long ago? Cue John Williams, buy your ticket and wait in your seats for Episode VIII."
ID_100257	"JJ made something that the previous trilogy completely missed; strong characters! Star Wars is back on track as we return to essentials: lovable, heartwarming and inspiring characters. Rey and Finn are the future of the saga! BB-8 had the same effect that R2D2 had in the original trilogy and fit in perfectly.All in all, Star Wars is back to its best! Pure 10/10"
ID_100258	A perfect blend of something fresh and familiar, the nostalgia feels are there but aren't the focus, the new characters are so exciting, stunning visual, emotionally effective space adventure, also does a lot of great world and character building that might be even more fun than before.P.s. In many places it feels like a reboot of episode IV.
ID_100259	"I saw Quentin Tarentino on Stephen Colbert the other night. He pointed out that no matter what movie he's gone to, he always remembers that it is still a movie...that he never falls into the spell to where he forgets. People say they do. He doesn't. I deliberately stayed away from any reviews or comments on this film. But I couldn't avoid all of the hype and that hype, by its very nature, made me constantly aware I was watching a movie that was going to make huge sums of money. I'm having trouble separating myself from that sense of ""why did they do this?"" And ""why did they choose her."" And, ""Isn't Harrison Ford a stitch."" Not Han Solo but Harrison Ford. Anyway, I have to admit that I sort of enjoyed it. It has lots of action, some interesting characters, a nostalgic feel, and so on. And a force is a force of course, of course. I skipped work so I could be at the first screening of the first ""Star Wars"" film back in 1977. I have to admit that as a reader of much challenging science fiction, I found the whole thing pretty bland. But it is a cultural entity, it bears watching. I don't know that there was much new here that would make one want badly to come back for more. When I saw the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy, I marked my calendar, hoping I would live to see all three episodes. And in that one, I already knew the plot. I'll be interested to see how this holds up to the test of time. For me the second set of the films are quite forgettable. And, again, for me, only one of the original caught my interest."
ID_100260	"This movie is a well made ""sequel"". I agree with many comments on this site: this is not a sequel, but a - to much commercially inspired - remake. The visual effects are perfect, the music is excellent, the actors are doing a perfect job. But still... the real Star Wars spirit is missing so much. The storyline is unidimensional and simplistic, the emotions are rather flat... Maybe the story was to complete after episode VI, and maybe it's just not possible to continue to milk this cow in a sensible way. I feel a bit betrayed in my expectations. For Episodes VIII, IX, X, .... till IC, I will wait for the BR-disk to be available instead of going to the movie theater."
ID_100261	Shoo. shoo. shoo. delete. remove. begone. eliminate. wipe clean
ID_100262	Im not a particularly a big fan of the Star Wars franchise. For a long time I found the Revenge of the Sith the most enjoyable of the lot. A New Hope and Return of the Jedi were probably the best of the series in terms of story, tone and humour. Thats until now. Screw nostalgia, the only thing which made the originals good is the time of its release and how revolutionary the trilogy was. The Revenge of the Sith had far much more action and story progression. But The Force Awakens blows it out of the water for action. Humour is a little more grown up and much less cheesy. It does seem like the same old rebels attach the spaceship scene which was the focal point of new hope and empire strikes back. And another lovechild turns bad so for originality its lacking in the plot. It does have a good tone in terms of the legend of the force and all the stories of the great battle. The First Order has emerged welcomingly however and I look forward to a much more grown up series with action like this one.
ID_100263	Isn't a little suspicious that a movie that has 95% approval by critics and 93% approval by fans at RottenTomatoes, an 81 score at Metacritic and a 8.1 overall score at IMDb has so much 1/10 stars reviews at the IMDb user reviews section? This section has been invaded by trolls. No doubt about it.I've watched this movie 3 times already and people always leave the theater with huge smiles on their faces. The Force Awakens is all about enjoying the ride — and what a ride! JJ Abrams achieved an impossible mission: he honored the past by setting the groundwork for the future without pissing off hardcore Star Wars fans.The pace of the movie and the witty dialogue makes the story fly. Much better than Return of the Jedi and especially the original, painfully outdated A New Hope. The Force Awakens is everything that fans and non-fans have been waiting for!
ID_100264	Really Great Movie ! First time watching star wars movies . It's far better than expectation
ID_100265	It is crucial that I don't spoil anything so I will stick to the general facts and the technical parts. The story you will have to find out on your own.I belong to a new generation that was introduced to SW when Episode I was coming out so I have a connection with the new trilogy as well as the old one. Still, the old one is way better and any and all debate about the quality of the movies ends here. The original trilogy is a masterpiece and revolutionized SF movies, the new one is visually stunning and fun. So, where does TFA fit in? I have to say that it has taken 32 years to make a real and powerful sequel. It has the magic of the original trilogy, but also visually stunning segments as the new trilogy.The story. The movie has a very slow and light way of revealing elements of the storyline. The script was well written and keeps one interested throughout the entire movie. Then, at one point it kicks you in the teeth with a stunning revelation that one just doesn't expect. That revelation is so strong and done so suddenly you just needs time for it to sink in, but just as that happens the story picks up the paste and leaves one with just one option - acceptance. Only a (jedi) master director could have done that in such a way. Also, this movie has one of the most unexpected and emotionally painful segments I have ever seen SW movies. All I can say is that it took some real courage to put it on the big screen. Furthermore, I feel obliged to defend this movie from all of the rambling that it is a remake/reboot. The movie has a very interesting way of playing with sequences seen in episode IV, and if you spotted them that only means you are a real SW fan. This movie is nowhere near a remake or a reboot nor does it want to be. It is a continuation of the original trilogy, and nothing more.The acting. Ridley and Boyega were phenomenal! She is extremely talented and all the scenes she was in just blew me away. Her possibility to switch from amazement to sorrow and loneliness were astonishing. Boyega on the other side was entertaining and a good comic relief. Still I had a feeling she had a harder character to portray so my compliments go to her. But, the best of them was Isaac who, I felt, had the time of his life playing Poe. But, I feel a bit more screen time could have been given to him because he could have given more. So lets wait for Episode VIII, maybe he gets more time there. As for Driver, his acting is so phenomenal that I am looking forward to his death scene more than anything else at this point. He understood exactly who he had to play and how. A great presentation. As for the old cast, well, it is very nice to see the original cast back in the movie that made them famous. Hamill's final appearance is an equivalent to the one done by Alec Guinness in a New Hope. Pure good and light just dripping from every segment of him. Fisher, despite her age, still pulls of Leia in a manner more serious and wiser that in the original trilogy. But, all of the compliments and standing ovations go to Harrison Ford, who gave the best performance of Han Solo ever. He is funny, he is filled with sorrow, he is kind, good, he is the ultimate childhood hero anyone could imagine.The CGI. It is crucial to say that there is very little CGI in this movie. Most of it looks real and the whole movie feels like it was done 30 years ago. The most important thing is that when CGI was used, it was used in small dosages and it was used wisely. There are spectacular fighting scenes, magnificent visual effects, done with very little CGI. The movie feels real and that is one of it's greatest advantages.The music. John Williams did a nice job here but, in my opinion, held back a bit for reasons unknown to me. Not a lot of the original music is present and when it is, it ends quite fast. Besides that, no new tunes can be heard.So, why 9/10? Well, the movie drags a bit at the middle and the music could have been more innovative or more tunes from previous movies should have been used.All in all, ladies and gentlemen, if you don't like this movie, then there is nothing else SW can do for you. It is the best possible sequel you could have hoped for, it is fun, it is dramatic, it has a great message. The original trilogy will never be made again and stop comparing them. View this movie as a sequel that really delivers to all the SW fans out there and all of the new ones that are yet to come. A new generation of SW fans are coming and they deserve a new generation of SW movies. Ones that will thrill and be corespondent with the time they are viewed in but still as powerful and great as the old ones. This movie is exactly that.May the force be with you.
ID_100266	Finally, the most anticipated movie of the 2015 is here! After gathering all the hype and hoopla around it over a year, Star Wars: The Force Awakens doesn't throw in any unpleasant surprises. Taking over from George Lucas, JJ Abrams makes sure he does not disappoint any Star Wars fans or cinema lovers in general. It is quite hard to make a sequel to the movie which had ended almost 30 years ago and especially when it comes to this era where most of the sequels are made just to mint money without a proper story, but Star Wars: The Force Awakens has quite a strong plot to build on. In fact with this movie, it looks like there are more to come.The story is once again about the conflict between 'The First Order' (like the Empire) and 'The Resistance' with the aim of finding lost Luke Skywalker. So for the fans asking where was Luke Skywalker in the trailer, the answer is 'that's what they are trying to find in the movie as well':-). The introduction of new characters Rey (Daisy Ridley), Finn (John Boyega) and Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) fit in the mix perfectly while the classic characters Han Solo, Leia, Chewbacca and C-3P0 still reminds us of what we watched Star Wars for. Since there is a huge time gap between the last Star Wars movie and this, there are changes with respect to the time when it comes to visual effects and slapstick humour (read Boyega). However the some of the original elements of the Star Wars are still kept intact like, the weird creatures, retro editing, lightsabers, music and of course taking hostages :). The movie is largely entertaining and yet true to the franchise.It is a tough job to star in a movie franchise which is older than you. But Daisy Ridley and John Boyega, not so well known British actors show what they are capable of. John Boyega's timing is excellent. Harrison Ford could sleepwalk the role of Han Solo and we all know that. Oscar Isaac does not have a lot of screenspace but it may change in the upcoming movies. Adam Driver as Kylo Ren is okay and Domhall Gleeson tries too hard to fit into the General Hux's character. However as always, Chewbacca and C-3P0 seem evergreen. Star Wars: The Force Awakens lives up to most of the expectations surrounding it. But remember, it is yet another beginning...
ID_100267	"Don't get me wrong. It's a fun movie. Great special effects, good action and likeable characters but it's also devoid of any originality to the point that it could be called a reboot. Also world building sucks and that Star Killer base was such a Deus ex machina. It was both taken straight from New Hope but also was a easy way for writers to erase all that happened between Return of The Jedi and Force Awakens.
To sum it up I don't regret watching it but I have no desire to see it again."
ID_100268	"I made an IMDb account just to say this: Even if you like 3D movies, do not see _The Force Awakens_ in 3D. This movie was not shot with 3D cameras. Not even the special effects shots were rendered in actual stereoscopic 3D. The whole thing is converted, and it's terrible. Characters often have the appearance of living cardboard cutouts. Sense of scale is horribly, horribly messed up. For example, we see a huge ship and part of it is made to look closer even though it is so far away that you shouldn't be able to see that effect (like how in real life, when you look at clouds near the horizon, they don't appear to have depth). Similarly with planets and other stuff. Instead of just looking natural, like movies shot or computer-rendered in 3D, the 3D is a distracting layer on top of what the cinematographer intended, drawing attention to whatever the people who did the conversion decided to push out or pull in from the screen. Combined with the usual drawbacks of the 3D technology (glasses darken the image and seem to ""box in"" the screen, etc.), it really got on my nerves, affecting my experience much more than I expected.Because of this distraction, I don't want to go in-depth on my opinion of the actual movie since it might very well have been different had I seen it in the original format. My feelings are ambivalent. On one hand it's mostly a rehash of the original trilogy with weaker characters and drama; on the other I can't deny that I (as someone who likes but is not super enthusiastic about _Star Wars_) had fun and was entertained. But I was hoping for something new and imaginative that would add to _Star Wars_, not just continue it.One of the reasons I saw it in 3D even though I would have preferred non-3D is that there are no IMAX showings (at least anywhere near me) that are not IMAX 3D. That's right, post-converted 3D is being forced on IMAX viewers, I presume so they can bump up the ticket price and because 3D attendance has been on the decline. Some parts of the film were shot in IMAX, and this means you can't see those parts in unadulterated IMAX.I feel bad that I already rewarded Disney and the theaters for this crap (not the film itself, just the way they're showing it) by shelling out extra for IMAX 3D. Please, don't reward them any more. If you see _The Force Awakens_, see it without 3D. You can save money (it's not like this movie needs more support) *and* have a better viewing experience.Edit: I found out that the IMAX 3D for this movie basically isn't even IMAX, in the vast majority of theaters (in the US at least). Can't link to articles; just google ""'the force awakens' 'IMAX 3D'"" and they should come up."
ID_100269	Star Wars fans and fans of baggage free thrill ride blockbusters for all ages rejoice as not only is the Force Awakens the return to the galaxy far far away we've been waiting these many long years for this is a Star Wars film that just could well be the most unarguably well made of the entire beloved series.Master of entertainment J.J Abrams film is an event film that puts many other big budgeted extravaganzas to shame with a near perfectly paced plotted narrative, rip roaring old school action that moulds the new with the old seamlessly, heavy doses of humour amongst the emotion and just a general sense of fun that flows through the very veins of Abrams and associates love letter to one of cinemas most beloved properties.With what seemed like the worlds expectations waiting with baited breathe on its shoulders, The Force Awakens successes of blending the old with the new and paying remembrances to past glories while also crafting its own its quite the feat and while it may not rip the rule book up and craft a totally unexpected or even an overly original story (a slight gripe is the 'dark sides' new major weapon which seems far too like devices of old), Star Wars has never been the film to craft a unique story of good vs evil, rather place it in a special place with special characters which The Force Awakens once more does to great effect.The original films found themselves so adored thanks to the rise of Luke Skywalker, the feistiness of Princess Leia, the friendship and adventures of the Millennium Falcon's Han Solo and Chewie and the battle they faced to save the universe and while all old cast mates from the films return here and do so extremely successfully in varying degrees of screen time – Han and Chewie especially, as they threaten to steal the show with their on point repertoire, Abrams has found a willing an effective batch of newcomers that will undoubtedly lead the property forward in an exciting way.While they may not be as instantly iconic as the first time we we saw the Luke's, the Leia's or the Hans, Daisy Ridleys determined and resourceful Rey, John Boyega's good natured Finn, Adam Drivers fearsome yet somehow sad big bad Kylo Ren and thankfully even the lovable and not overused BB8 quickly become new members of the universe that we can get to know, love and loathe and its great to rest on the fact that as our treasured original cast become far to old to continue their intergalactic battles these newest members of the series will be taking over the drivers seat as seen sometimes quite literally in this film.Particular mention must be made of Ridley and her turn as Rey, it's a star making turn and also a brave directional turn from the filmmakers to hand the mantle to a genuine unknown but both the actress and character are fantastic. Driver on the other hand is now a well known talent and his Kylo is a volatile, short tempered and even vulnerable villain that may alienate some fans but win an equal amount of new ones and every time he is on screen the film sizzles and his lightsaber is all types of epic.In regards purely to the story Abrams, Michael Arndt and series veteran Lawrence Kasdan have crafted there's again nothing overly new here but it's done in such a fun, fast paced and often breathtaking manner that it quite truly doesn't matter and there's moments to make the audience clap, cheer, jeer and even shed a tear and a few fabulously designed scenes and scenarios that will be sure to bring those goose-bump chills. It's also the film that suits itself to little pre-knowledge so going in with little story knowledge will make the experience that much more enjoyable.The Force Awakens is far from perfect yet when we take off our rose tinted glasses and forgo all nostalgia are any of the Star Wars films?The Force Awakens has delivered on the unparalleled hype and the high expectations that have encompassed it from the day it was announced from all corners of the globe and managed to be the film long serving fans, more recent appreciators and fresh recruits can all be taken away by.The force is indeed strong with this one so let the countdown begin for the next exciting chapter in this now safely back on track saga that looks set to live long and prosperously for years to come yet.4 1/2 Mad Dogs out of 5
ID_100270	"The Force Awakens isn't perfect entertainment and we should all stop pretending Star Wars movies as a whole have to be flawless(The Prequel Trilogy also gets held up to that kind of scrutiny, as well as The Original Trilogy). They're not THE films by which ALL movies must be compared to; films like Sunset Boulevard or Citizen Kane are more suited for that purpose to compare movies to because they were benchmark films that set the stage for Hollywood movies then onward, even though they weren't films driven by special effects. Cinema is an evolving art form and it's bound to repeat some things. Is that really a bad thing especially when the film in question is only a 'soft-reboot' and not a shot-by-shot remake of the original? I say no: it isn't. The Force Awakens is a blockbuster that's derivative but progressive, familiar but fresh. It's not perfect but it's Star Wars through and through.Star Wars Episode VII: The Force Awakens was finally released in 2015 to audience, critical and commercial fanfare: it was named one of the AFI's Top 10 Films of 2015, grossed $U.S.2.07 billion at the global box office and was credited with revitalizing the Star Wars franchise. However, there were some ardent fans who criticized the film for its redundancies they wished weren't featured in the film, and I can understand those criticisms; I just don't agree with those who hold those issues against the film. The Force Awakens is an overdue visit from an old friend that you've been wanting to see again for years. And you find that the friend has made some notable changes since the last time you saw him. You see what was there before but you can also feel and embrace the new stuff as well; and that's very true for the story of The Force Awakens.The Force Awakens is a blast to watch: it's intergalactic fun that honors the previous movies beautifully and manages to feel new while strictly being a self-aware Star Wars romanticist's film made for people who grew up on The Original Trilogy.The Force Awakens gets 5/5 stars."
