ID_100091	Great story and action. Even an emotional twist. Character's even better than the New Hope. JJ did it right. Absolute entertainment is what this episode has. I suggest go to Disney x and complete the marathon before #9.
ID_100092	I knew going in to this film that it wasn't going to be as good as the first two films. Still, I did have high expectations for this film that unfortunately feel flat. This film seems like the first three films thrown together in a blender. With the all the similarities, I was surprised there were no ewoks in the film. Aside from the plot, I felt like the old characters were given too much screen time. While I do love Harrison Ford (My favorite actor), I feel that a lot of the time he doesn't fit into the plot. His relationship with Leia seems forced. These old characters overshadow the potential of Rey and Finn. I like the two new main characters along with Poe who is great in the film. But, this overshadowing wasn't just during the film. Mark Hamill was SECOND BILLED in the credits and didn't have a SINGLE line! He was more important in Kingsman as Professor Arnold than he was in his signature film series. The one thing that saved this film was the action. It may have been michael bay- esque, but at least it was awesome. Episode IV and V in my opinion are 10/10 movies, but this film just didn't cut it. I'm not that big of a star wars fans as I haven't seen the prequel movies, but I know this one seemed like a Brady Bunch reunion. 6/10
ID_100093	"A perfectly balanced blend of charming love-letter to the style and structure of the original trilogy, infused with an emphatic freshness of humour and new ideas, creates what could be argued to be the purest straight Star Wars film of the entire saga. Paced to perfection as it hits the familiar narrative beats we come to expect, Awakens is alive with the over-the-top action and stirring sentimentality of the films we grew up with while also casting very modern shadow of intrigue and mystery that sets the mind whirring with possibilities as the story moves forward; a shot of pure adrenaline to the heart of the Star Wars fan in all of us that had laid dormant for ten years since Lucas completed his prequel trilogy."
ID_100094	"Star Wars To Do List: 1. Throw lots of money at an already established franchise. 2. Give a director lots of money to ""reboot"" an already established franchise. 3. Throw lots of money at a good writer who couldn't care less at this point, tell him to just tweek the first episode, then throw even more money at him. 4. Get the old beloved characters back and throw lots of money at them so they'll show up. 5. Introduce some new actors to hopefully appeal to younger audiences. Throw lots more money at them. 6. CGI and LOTS OF IT!!! 7. Throw in a bigger, more explosive death star. Blow it up, then rebuild a bigger one to blow up in the next installment. 8. And the profits start rolling in. (Disney destroys all it touches. 'Nuff said.)"
ID_100095	Abrams had the benefit of learning what didn't work in Lucas' prequels, and he's gone in the opposite direction. He's also set an interesting course for moving forward with this engaging cast playing new characters making their way through this beloved universe.
ID_100096	It's over 30 years since the defeat of the empire. The Republic is threatened by the First Order led by Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) under the control of Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis). The resistance led by General Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher) is fighting the Dark Side. Finn (John Boyega) is a conflicted stormtrooper. Rey (Daisy Ridley) is a scavenger on the planet Jakku. Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) is the Resistance ace pilot.It has been over 30 years since the last truly good Star Wars movie. It is a great reboot and a solid repair job to the damage from the prequels. The biggest complaint seems to be that this is a repeat of A New Hope. If anything, this is pulling out scenes and references from all three originals. I have no problems with that. In fact, it's good to go back and take pages out of the original trilogy. Even the force is explained more in the traditional way. However, this is not a simple repeat. The new characters are tremendous. John Boyega and Daisy Ridley are amazing additions. He's an interesting character and I love their initial meeting. I love him keep grabbing her hand. There are some minor problems but they're too minor to mention especially considering the spoilers. I rank 'The Empire Strikes Back' (1980) the best, 'A New Hope' (1977) second, and I may squeeze 'The Force Awakens' slightly ahead of 'Return of the Jedi' (1983). Forget the prequels.P.S. In this one, nobody loses a lightsaber fight because of elevation.
ID_100097	Another decade has past and J.J. Abrams, resurrector of franchises, has come to take his swing at bringing back a sense of movie magic to Star Wars. Did he succeed? I don't know yet. It's hard to judge such a hyped movie after a first viewing and this one leaves me with mixed, but positive feelings after watching it.I liked the new characters introduced in the movie and their acting was great (especially compared to the returning stars) and this fact leaves me with a lot of hope for the upcoming episodes. The movie also had a real sense of 'fun' to it which is good. Even if it's a dark subject matter at times it's also a fantastical and for many people uplifting story at the core of it. Sometimes I felt it was a bit too much fun but this is one of the things that will probably settle with further viewings.Onto the things I did not like as much. I thought the movie lost some of it's pacing a bit into the story. This might have had something to do with the weight all the intertwined characters and personal developments placed on the movie, I think that was the case at least, but this is also something I think will improve in the upcoming movies.In the end it's the Star Wars we probably needed right now. It's nowhere near the originals, but it's also light years from the prequels, and it sets us off on a journey towards a greater saga in episode eight and nine as well as within the extended universe.
ID_100098	"Star Wars: The Force Awakens is a fabulous film and is a good dose of escapism from mundane everyday life, just like The Original Trilogy was. We can forget all our problems when seeing this movie. The Force Awakens sparks a joy for the child in all of us which many of us have been waiting for since The Empire strikes Back or Return of the Jedi. There couldn't have been a story more worthy of the subtitle 'Episode VII'.After the whole Trade Negotiations rubbish that plagued the Star Wars Prequel Trilogy. J.J. Abrams reinvigorates the assaulted franchise and gives us some of the most powerful moments ever seen in the saga.Don't give in to the trolling of the prequel or original trilogy fanboys. They're just upset that somebody did a much stronger job than Lucas could have managed on his own. They couldn't tell a good movie apart from Transformers 3 & 4, or any Michael Bay movie for that matter. We are entitled to our own opinion and mustn't succumb to these 'emotion vampires' that do their best and ultimately fail to make a difference in the end.The Force Awakens is a refreshingly fun film that as a form of escape in this day and age plagued by terrorism, cyber-terrorism, LGBT discrimination and racism. Star Wars is a welcoming series that isn't conformed by anything in our world ; it's a self-realising ecstasy that will always be there for us like an old friend. 10 stars"
ID_100099	"Basically adequate reboot of this legendary film series offers up a reasonably entertaining story, but one without much resonance. The special effects often tend to take over, and there's not really that much threat from the villains on hand. While it is a treat to see veterans of the franchise return to their beloved roles, they mostly take a back seat to the new characters. Yes, the yarn concocted here by director J.J. Abrams and original series screenwriter Lawrence Kasdan feels awfully familiar at times; there's no denying that. ""The Force Awakens"" also tends to get a little overly precious, as it concerns the new droid character BB-8.30 years after the Rebels helped to eliminate the Empire and destroy their second Death Star, a new evil entity has emerged to take the Empires' place. They're the ""First Order"", and one of their number is a moody young Jedi named Kylo Ren (Adam Driver). Not helping matters is the fact that original hero Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) has disappeared at this time when he's needed the most. The Rebels are now re-christened The Resistance, and Leia, now a general with this organization, seeks to find her missing brother. Drawn into the fray are Finn (John Boyega of ""Attack the Block""), a former Stormtrooper who experienced a change of heart, and Rey (Daisy Ridley), a desert scavenger.""The Force Awakens"" yields adequate entertainment, and attempts to deliver some genuine emotion, but it fails to be completely engaging. It's got a breathless pace to it, and lots of action. The cast features a number of familiar faces, but they've been better utilized in other things. Harrison Fords' Han Solo, who's gone back to his mercenary ways, gets the lions' share of screen time compared to his fellow alumni of Episodes IV to VI. He, at least, is in fine form. But Kylo Ren is an underwhelming villain, as is the all-powerful figure Snoke from whom he takes his orders. He's a pipsqueak compared to Darth Vader. It's also a real shame to have the legendary Max von Sydow on hand in the opening minutes, in such a regrettably brief cameo appearance. Fortunately, Boyega and Ridley are appealing heroes and anchor this stage of the saga pretty well. And the expected abundance of CGI is complemented by a respectable amount of practical effects.Overall, a well intentioned but uninspired continuation of Episodes I to VI.Six out of 10."
ID_100100	"I previously wrote a scathing review of this film and gave it 3 stars. I now have to give it 8 for the music alone. The music is a ""10"" but the film is a ""3"". Let me explain.You would think that in this day and age that music would be electronic and automated. Last night, my wife attended a performance of the Santa Barbara Symphony where they ended with music from the original Star Wars (what my kids know as Episode 4). The conductor congratulated the musicians from that orchestra who made the music for this film! It was about half the orchestra that had been in the orchestra for the latest Star Wars movie!The music was entirely acoustic! That is to say, all the instruments of the orchestra were non- electronic instruments played by real people. You have to admit the music is fantastic. The conductor of the Santa Barbara Symphony pointed out that these were some of the most heard musicians on stage. Full disclosure: I am a professional musician myself with a degree from one of the great music schools (I play the pipe organ).While I was not impressed by the plot nor the visual effects, the music makes this film worthwhile."
ID_100101	A fun romp that holds true to the wit, adventure, and visual spectacle of the original trilogy. The sights, sounds, and feel hearkens back to when this franchise knew what it was doing. I look forward to many more viewings and the follow-on films to come.
ID_100102	"The fate of a foot soldier, an ageing pirate (and his loyal sidekick), a young girl, a star pilot and the leader of an enemy army, all collide and intertwine in this highly anticipated return of the Star Wars series.It was with apprehension that I approached The Force Awakens. Having invested a great deal of expectation and anticipation into the prequels during my formative adult years, I approached TFA with a sense of withdrawal. This stemmed from the fear I have that any amount of hype would eventually just leave me in another state of devastation and possible resignation to the knowledge that our heroes (George Lucas, I'm looking at you) will always remain all too human, a state which I have never quite recovered from. Well TFA has somehow restored my faith in movie-making, and possibly in life itself, from the first moment when the words ""A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away"" appeared, to the second when the ubiquitous blue credits started rolling at the end. For the whole duration I was taken back to my youth, more specifically, the heady days of the early nineties, not to a time when I yearned for adventure and sought mystical powers to defeat my enemies, but to a time when all that I demanded from certain sci-fi adventure movies was that they were as good as Star Wars.TFA is most certainly a movie that can stand quite proudly amongst the original trilogy. J.J Abrams vision shows a director who has a deft eye for the spectacular whilst equally comfortable paying homage to his predecessors. A good clue to this movies retro roots is in the title itself, ""The Force Awakens"", the director J.J Abrams definitely reclaims the power and mysticism of 'the force'. In the prequels ""the force"" became a throwaway trope, everybody had the force in the prequels and it was used so flagrantly that we forgot it's true intangible qualities. In TFA, as the name suggests 'the force' is used sparingly, but to great effect (there was one particular scene where I had to fight the urge to applaud in the cinema). J.J Abrams clearly understands the text that he has be given along with it's wider fandom, and rather than shrink, he has rose to the occasion and brought us something great, spectacular and touching epochal.In terms of story telling, the characters of Rey and Finn carry the lions share of the plot, whilst characters such as Han Solo, Chewbacca and Princess Leia return to add some much appreciated gravitas to proceedings. Also there should be a mention for the actor Adam Driver playing the latest antagonist Kylo Renn. Driver plays this role well and is convincing in his troubled persona, appearing evil yet at the same time angst ridden. In previous instalments both Anakin Skywalker and Darth Vader carried this duality inside of them, but Kylo Renn truly embodies this fear (and rage) as an integral part of his character. Through his portrayal of Kylo Renn, Driver elevates what could have so easily been a poor mans Darth Vader to a character that is fresh and suitably imperious.Now to address some of the criticisms directed at the movie. Some may argue that rather than paying homage TFA is in effect a reboot/re-telling of the original trilogy, twists and turn and all, WITH the inclusion of a Death Star and a masked villain who has more than a passing resemblance to Darth Vader. You could even go further and say that whole characters along with their personality traits have been cut and pasted from the original trilogy and plonked square onto a whole host of characters in TFA. Whilst this is undeniable and some might argue all too obvious, the only defence that I can give to this is that TFA is the first of a new trilogy. The faint whiff of a movie making process that is hedging it's bets on how to develop it's character, and what direction to take it in, has not quite come about fully formed.To take it to another discussion I think Hollywood has learnt that introducing new characters to a well known and beloved movie series (I hate the term franchise) can be a precarious one, Jar Jar Binks being the go to model of new characters that did not quite resonate with an audience. So it is very likely that the writers erred on the side of caution and made certain characters from TFA a composite of what was great about previous characters in the original/prequels. Is it noticeable, yes, is it enough to distract and cause this audience member to cry foul, no.Ultimately, once all the analysis has been done, The Force Awaken succeeds in reinvigorating and restoring the lustre of the original trilogy. A lustre that had been besmirched by the god awful George Lucas prequels. It has been noted by many commentators that the prequel trilogy was too explanatory, telling the story in a way which was both lacking in subtlety, yet somehow at the same time convoluted and bogged down in some civil war/trade politics that nobody could quite explain nor care for. The Force Awakens dispenses with all the faux political subtexts that effectively ruined the prequels and takes the story back to the heart of the original trilogy. That heart being the story of an everyday young hero longing for adventure, who is then taken on a fantastical journey and on the way meet an unlikely crew of bandits and mis-fit companions. Eventually said hero discovers that their life not only has a higher purpose, but that greatness is, and always has been inherent within them. It's a story as old as story telling itself, but when done right, it hits the mark every time."
ID_100103	For many years that you have been aching for a good massage. You have been to Thailand many years back and had an excellent massage by the sea. The masseuse applied strange techniques, and you wondered she knew what she was doing. But as her finger touched your upper back, you cried. You cried with joy. It was a feeling like never before. It was something that you could never forget. And in your trip, you went for massage three times, till each muscle in your body and brain was filled with nostalgia.You tried getting the same feeling again at your local massage parlor. You tried three times, but all you got was disappointment, regret and more craving to visit Thailand again.Now you learned about opening of a new Thai massage parlor in your town. You are strangely excited, though also scared if it will be again a disappointment like the last three times. But you wait. You watch the shop getting setup with anticipation. You read their brochure - with staff from Thailand. Your hopes go up. On the day of opening you go there to have another full body massage.And from the first touch you know it's not like the last three times. It's different. It's like the original massage of the Thailand. It uses same everything. The steps of the massage, the scent of the room, even the masseuse looks the same(and then you remember it's racist to think all Asians looks the same).You tell the masseuse to do you more on the upper back and shoulders, but then you realizes that she doesn't speak English. You tell yourself that it's OK. Your muscles are still touched. Then she goes to your calves and pinch it like squeezing lemon. You remember that you didn't like it first time but it's not something that need to be repeated. But of course, you can't tell your masseuse. You fall into sleep while she's rubbing your head and you ponder about the new Star War movie you just saw.It got rid of all the bad things in the prequels (i.e. writer and director George Lucas) So you don't have bad dialogs, cardboard characters and dull acting. The fight scenes look real and there are people in the movie you care about. It's really good start to a new trilogy (or quadrilogy, depending on the studious decision to split last movie into two) The actors have acted very well an there are character arcs, which make the conflict so much engaging. There are cool fight scenes and some funny dialogs. It's like the director listened to every complain people had from the prequels and tried to fix it this time, which resulted in a really great movie.You wake up from your sleep. The massage is now over. You pay the fee and give some more money as tip. You walk out of the parlor feeling great. And as you walk, it comes to you that this massage was too similar to the massage you had in Thailand. It would have been better if they could have got rid of the calf squeezing thing, it doesn't work every time. Also, there were lot of things that didn't make sense. Why did she twisted your earlobes? There is no tension in earlobes to relieve. It took you only ten seconds to walk from counter to cabin, but when the masseuse went to get oil, it took her ten minutes. Lot more things come to your mind, but then you tell yourself that you enjoyed the massage, all these things doesn't matter. You think about your next trip to the parlor and feel excited.
ID_100104	"JJ Abrahams has directed a fine Star Wars movie with numerous hidden references and Easter eggs which are pretty mind blowing once they are found out. Many fans keep complaining how the plot is similar to ""A New Hope"". However, a saga prominent as this one must recapture what was observed more than 3 decades ago to show obvious relevance to the past."
ID_100105	My review of this entry is simple, it is a New Hope redone with new characters and a couple of different twists. Does this make it bad? No. There is no such thing as a bad Star Wars film. The problem with the lifelong fans, of which I am, I was four when A New Hope was released, is that they want to recapture the awe and splendor that they experienced when Star Wars first came out. It will never happen people.
ID_100106	This is so easily the overall best movie in the Star Wars franchise it's not even remotely up for debate (with The Last Jedi an incredibly close second!) Great story, excellent acting, brilliant action, etc etc etc etc.The cinematography was sweeping and excellent. The characters were imaginative and fresh. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and would watch it again without hesitation. The plot was easily the best of the entire series and the cast were all outstanding in their parts as well.Can't wait for yet another 12 out 10 masterpiece with Episode 9, once again directed by THE KING!
ID_100107	"Just ignore the haters and toxic fanboys who just love to hate a star wars film and enjoy this movie, it's way more fun than those horribly aged prequels
yes it's similar to a new hope but it's not a remake of it because the characters and story its different, it's what this franchise needed the fans wanted a classic simple star wars and jj did just that and much more.the only two negatives i have is that it there is another death star again... and carrie fishers acting other than that it's a pretty decent star wars movie."
ID_100108	I just rewatched Episode 7 and maintain my opinion that I really like it. I looked through the IMDb reviews of this film and cannot believe the hatred for this film. It seems that some people just hate for hatred sake. The biggest complaint that I see is that it is a rehash of Episode 4. I have to agree that it is very similar to it but after the absolute hatred that was unfairly bestowed on the prequel trilogy I knew that this would be a big budget fan film. Which it is. I am not bothered by that. George Lucas was criticized to the point of ridiculousness about how Episode 1 thru 3 weren't like the previous trilogy that there was no other way to.go. Does episode 7 break new ground? No. Does it harken back tl.the reason i.love Star Wars? Yes. That was enough for me.
ID_100109	"The Force Awakens is fun and action-packed, if derivative, entertainment. It pays several homages to the original trilogy and introduces new characters, most of which are interesting. The story, as many have mentioned, is a rehash of Ep. IV, V, VI, to varying degrees, but I won't be stressing on that in this review since it's been validly stressed upon already. The CGI of course is great, and while it isn't used to add any new landscapes or settings, it does justice to the pre-established worlds of star wars. The background score is competent. I believe the acting has never been a forte of the Star Wars trilogy. Barring, Luke Skywalker there isn't really much in the way of brilliant 'acting' as opposed to mere 'reacting' to various situations and dangers. This is not to say that Darth Vader wasn't a villain of epic proportions, nor does it take away anything from the charismatic hero that was Han Solo, the only point being, that these characters were brought to life by brilliantly engaging story arcs, intelligent dialogue and individual peculiarities; Darth Vader's ominous voice, and Han Solo's rebellious charm. Yet, these have less to do with the more conventional sense of great acting; in the potent expression of emotions and thoughts, as wide as they may be. Heath Ledger's terrific performance in The Dark Knight is universally lauded, just as Jack Nicholson's in The Shining; that is the acting that levels great. And that is why, the acting in TFA does not specifically surprise me, it is only more of the same. The acting is good enough to serve the purpose. I don't think anyone has to be convinced to watch this movie, because all nostalgic fans of old will definitely flock to the theatre to relive their childhoods and younger generations will be attracted to this simply due to the overwhelming hype around the film, so instead of writing a review of why one should or shouldn't watch this film, I'd rather discuss what this film IS. I believe this movie is the bait, by which Disney is sizing up the audience that will stay loyal to it in the sequels sure to come. It adopts the role of passing on the baton, so to speak. Eclipsing the prequels, this movie is the first real visit to Star Wars in over 30 years and hence admittedly, there must be adequate portions of remembrance both in visuals and in sentiment, of what made the first trilogy so great while pleasantly setting up new story arcs and characters. This movie gives us a taste of the breadth of stories and character arcs that are inevitable in the movies to come. SPOILERS SPOILERS- I say this because the movie does not really have any exposition for particulars like- WHAT happened to the happy ending that was 'Return of the Jedi'? HOW and when did the 'First Order' come into existence? WHAT were the circumstances under which Rey was left abandoned on a desert planet? WHAT specifically led to Kylo Ren being seduced by the Dark side? WHY does the map to Luke even exist, if his location was after all supposed to be undisclosed?? WHAT Force after all, has been awakened?WHY did a hibernating R2D2 suddenly spring to life and save the day after years of being inactive? HOW did Rey, while being prisoner at Kylo's ship brainwash a guard to set her free, without the least bit of training? And for that matter, why would Kylo leave a single guard to watch over his most valued prisoner, and also, after she is set free, how is it that the stormtroopers are unable to locate her via cameras aboard the ship? Do they really NOT have any cameras on board despite all the amazing technology they have? HOW is Rey able to battle and defeat a Sith Lord mere hours after learning that she might have the Force within her?It is questions such as these, that are left unanswered, and while it does provide much fodder for the sequels, it leaves the movie itself achingly short of depth and clarity. END OF SPOILERKylo Ren was an intriguing villain upto the point at which he takes off his mask for no real reason. Finn was occasionally funny but not too real. Poe seemed like a great lead character but he was under used. Han Solo was good. Rey, however was the best of the crew in that she seemed to have an interesting backstory while also playing an important role in the progression of the movie itself. The action sequences are reminiscent of the those from the OT, and are well done. All in all, TFA is great nostalgia-fun for hardcore fans and laidback-fun for the rest. If only it brought some closure to even a couple of the questions that it leaves unanswered, it would have benefited gravely. And had it dared to venture new plot lines, of course."
ID_100110	"Let me say this right off the bat: ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" is not a horrible film. I'm sure most people in their right minds will agree with this statement. I personally think that people have the wrong idea about what makes ""Star Wars"" great in the first place. It's a simple, straightforward, and fast-moving story. There are clear villains and heroes. Frenetic action that is spectacle and also suspenseful. ""Star Wars"" is not a thinking man's franchise. It never has been. So for anyone who criticizes this movie for being unoriginal and just derivative of the original trilogy: the original trilogy itself was unoriginal and derivative of fairy tales, science fiction serials, and Japanese cinema. George Lucas was a visionary in terms of bringing us an interesting and unique universe as dressing for a simple fairy tale story, and also by bringing us ground-breaking special effects. He was never a terrific storyteller, so people who come to a ""Star Wars"" movie expecting to see something that will move you or make you think, I'm sorry that you have that impression of the franchise.""The Force Awakens"" is set about thirty years after the end of ""Return of the Jedi."" In that span of time, Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) began training a new generation of Jedi Knights. After his academy was destroyed, Luke went into hiding somewhere within unknown space. Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) and the First Order, who are the remnants of the Galactic Empire, are looking for a map that will lead to the location of Luke, but Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac), a pilot for the Resistance, hides the map inside his droid, BB-8. Rey (Daisy Ridley) is a scavenger on the desert planet Jakku. She finds BB-8 and also runs into Finn (John Boyega), an ex-stormtrooper who fled to the surface, and the trio escape the planet on board the Millennium Falcon. They are eventually tracked down by Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew/Joonas Suotamo), who lead them to the Resistance base.I will admit, this movie is flawed. Rey is probably the worst part of this movie. It's incredibly un-dramatic to have a main character that can literally do everything by herself and never fail. Also, the story beat where we have yet another planet-killing super weapon is very dull. The forced Marvel-esque humor also feels really out of place in this franchise. This movie also has the misfortune of being followed by two of the most controversial films in the saga. I think that people will unfairly group this movie with those in a package critique of the sequel trilogy for many years to come. Which is unfortunate, because I actually think this movie shines in a lot of places.Harrison Ford absolutely steals the show in his most iconic role. It's so awesome to see him slip back into being Han Solo after thirty years. And there's some heartfelt character development here as well. He's much more mature and wise this time around. I love how he's still making and breaking deals with the low-life riff raff of the galaxy. Kylo Ren is also really cool too. It's interesting to see a ""Star Wars"" villain who struggles with the pull to the light side. We're often just shown the pull of the dark side from the perspective of our heroes, but I really like the concept that Kylo Ren is a lost individual who might not be as evil as he would like to be, and that certain actions he takes in the film don't necessarily satisfy him in the ways that he would like. This is good character writing.Finn is slightly less compelling. I like the idea of one of our heroes being an ex-stormtrooper, but this concept never really goes anywhere after he initially leaves the First Order. I like the scene where he fights one of the other stormtroopers, but I wish we were given more scenes where we may have been shown the impact that the First Order had on him. Maybe if he had a good friend that he had to leave behind or something like that.The plot is always straightforward and very easy to follow, which is a lot more than can be said for other ""Star Wars"" movies. Like I said earlier, this franchise is not meant to be taken so seriously. They're light-hearted adventure movies. Action scenes are visually engaging. The lightsaber duel at the end is visceral and brutal; it feels much more like an actual sword fight than the highly choreographed ballerina-twirling of the prequel trilogy. And that can be said of this movie in general; there seems to be so much more life and energy here than in the entire prequel trilogy that preceded it.The ""Star Wars"" saga had a definitive ending with ""Return of the Jedi."" There didn't need to be any other movies expanding the story beyond the destruction of the Empire. There's also the sad reality to contend with that ""The Force Awakens"" will always be attached to the abysmal mess that was ""The Rise of Skywalker."" But if you take this movie alone on its own; if you sit down with a bowl of popcorn and dim the lights and just shut off your brain for two and a half hours, you're going to be surprised by how much you actually like this movie. The energy and life and fun that it has with itself propel it beyond its confines within a larger saga. People really need to just chill about ""Star Wars"" and learn how to enjoy a fun movie. This is a fun movie."
ID_100111	"As we know Disney has bought the rights for the all next Star Wars films. The moment was right, the comic book movies are on top of the production and is expected to decline. George Lucas has enough of it. Disney see this as a very good chance to score.I speak here a little bit from my own experience because I worked for 10 years in Germany, the children show ""Die Sendung mit der Maus"". After so much time you got enough from this franchise. And if somebody gets to you with the money, You would not think twice. The same thing is with George Lucas. I do not wanna compare me with him but....The money has to be recovered and it is a huge amount of money. It is an investment of at least of following 12-15 years.Disney simply thought to copy the episode IV and to make a fresh start for the next generations. Sorry but we are old (44 years), yes and got the kid from my own. The story is the same as the episodes IV with the some old and the new characters, and is located some 30 years later in the future.But has anybody ever seen in the last 20 years a really good movie from Disney, not counting animation films???Easy answer. Nobody ! So, what did you expect???This is a simple answer to why the film has failed. Other people have already written in their reviews more about other stuff, so I do not want repeat all of it."
ID_100112	"Did the world really need ANOTHER Star Wars movie? It depends on who you ask. Star Wars junkies don't count as they're a notoriously biased and juvenile bunch and obviously they can't get enough of all things star wars, no matter how bad or unnecessary they may be. To everybody else, like me, the answer is NO.This movie is totally unnecessary and adds absolutely nothing to the Star Wars saga. To make matters worse, it's boring, predictable and simply juvenile. There's nothing original, good or memorable about it, other than the star wars label that attracts so much media attention and, therefore, sells so well. Harrison Ford looked jaded, bored and generally unconvincing. Everybody else was mediocre at best. The special effects are good, but if all a movie has going for it are special effects and no substance, then, no matter how ""prestigious"" the title and its history, one can't help but go away empty-handed and express a negative opinion. I've never been a star wars fan but I still went to see the movie with an open mind expecting to see, at least, a decent movie. As the clock ticked, though, I just got more and more bored, frustrated and disappointed. When I left the theater, I felt screwed by the Hollywood propaganda machine and by all the fake positive reviews I've read over the past few days pretty much everywhere. Rest assured this will be the first and last Star Wars movie I've ever paid to see.Do yourself a favor: if you want to see a truly memorable, meaningful movie, check out ""Bridge of Spies"" by Steven Spielberg."
ID_100113	Taking the first Star Wars with a fresh twist, it contains many subtle elements that tie in with the original film. Yet, this film is basically a repeat of the last, just with some fresh faces. That is not necessarily a bad thing however. It's a winning formula. For the fans, you'll absolutely love it.However, for the newbies, I highly recommend that this not be the first film you watch if you're trying to dip your toes into the whole saga(aka me but bad idea, trust me). With too many insider 'jokes' of sorts, there's much that would unfortunately not be appreciated if you started here. The Mandalorian is significantly easier to stomach in that sense.
ID_100114	"Its finally here. After Disney's $4 Billion acquisition of Lucasfilm back in 2012, the announcement that there would be a sequel trilogy beginning with a 7th episode in the beloved franchise was met with intrigue and excitement by fans everywhere. I am a longtime fan of the saga(both the originals and prequels to a degree); and I have spent countless dollars on games(most recently Star Wars Battlefront) , books, and tuned in to the cartoon Star Wars: The Clone Wars and Star wars rebels from time to time.This review will be lengthy, but there is so much to say about Star Wars: The Force Awakens.Starting with the actors, Star Wars The Force Awakens has a star-studded cast. John Boyega, who I have followed since his role in the film Attack the Block, stars as Finn alongside actress Daisy Ridley who plays Rey. They are very likable as the main protagonists, with Finn wanting to leave his life behind as a stormtrooper and Rey being a self-reliant person from the planet Jakku. I also very much enjoyed Oscar Isaac's role as X-Wing pilot Poe Dameron; and I hope we see more of his character in the future Star Wars films. It was nice to see the return of characters like Chewbacca, Carrie Fisher's Princess Leia, and seeing Harrison Ford make his return as Han Solo garnered a round of applause from the audience and myself. Andy Serkis stars as Supreme Leader Snoke and does a nice job, while Gwendoline Christie portrays Captain Phasma. Domhnall Gleeson makes his character General Hux a memorably vocal antagonist. But perhaps most satisfying of all the characters is Adam Driver's Kylo Ren. My friends and I discussed Star Wars: The Force Awakens well before its release, and though our opinions differed, we all agreed that the movie absolutely needed a imposing and memorable villain. And Kylo Ren is just that. I enjoyed how much Star Wars: The Force Awakens explored Kylo's persona and duality; while at the same time giving explanation as to how he came to be just who he is.The story in Star Wars: The Force Awakens adds new elements but has constant reminders that will delight Star Wars fans(as they did me) of why they are fans of the popular space opera in the first place. JJ Abrams incorporates humour into Star Wars: The Force Awakens, but it works very well. And there are numerous surprises , and some moments that hit your emotional side.And even better, the action scenes in the movie are absolutely wonderful. The lightsaber battles are noticeably different here than previous films, and the familiar theme music that we all know and love will definitely be heard in Star Wars: The Force Awakens. Taking over the directorial duties for a Star Wars film is no easy task, but JJ Abrams has done an impressive job creating this film.I'd like to point out that the ONLY problem I had with Star Wars: The Force Awakens is that there were certain characters I would have like to have seen have more screen time. But even still, Star Wars: The Force Awakens delivers spectacle, and wonder thanks to the talented cast, the direction of JJ Abrams, and the likable combination of old/new elements to the I sincerely hope everyone enjoys Star Wars: The Force Awakens as much as I did. Star Wars: The Force Awakens is a nice reminder that this is why we go to the movies. And truthfully, I am excited to see where the franchise goes next."
ID_100115	"My intention is always to keep my reviews spoiler-free, and this will be no exception.Since January 2013, when it was announced that J.J. Abrams would take on the onerous job of directing Star Wars 7, Star Wars fans have held their collective breath. You could feel the nervous tension, mixed with fervent anticipation, as the lights dimmed at the packed midnight showing at 00:01 on 17th December 2015. Could Abrams deliver or would the Disney-powered hype dissolve in a lens-flared dissipation of metaclorians? Well, the wait is over and the result is in. And it's a triumphant victory prepare to be gushed at! I would normally recap the basic plot at this point in my review, but to do so could potentially ruin some of the monumental twists and surprises of the story, which is both simple but Shakespearean in its breadth. The film has been a masterclass in marketing, throwing up feverish debate in the fan-world: why was Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) absent from both the trailers and the poster? Why is one of the heroes, Finn (John Boyega), seen wearing a stormtrooper outfit? Who is Kylo Ren (Adam Driver)? No answers here, but all great questions skillfully answered through the screenplay.So I will stick to the well-worn facts of the pre-publicity: that the film is set some 30 years after the historic events of ""Return of the Jedi"" (but still a ""Long Time Ago""), and centres on talented yet frustrated starship mechanic Rey (Daisy Ridley) stranded in a dead-beat job on the desert planet of Yakku (which all feels nostalgically familiar to someone who is old enough to have been there at the start of it all). Through the intervention of a droid with an embedded secret (ditto) she is dragged into the workings of the Republic's fight against a resurgent dark-side in the form of ""The First Order"", going 100% Hitler including an alien Nuremberg-style rally that is all red, black and white.What makes the film succeed is a strong emphasis back on story and character over effects (with the latter of course still being awesome). All of the acting is fine, with Oscar Isaac's heroic pilot Poe Dameron being particularly strong and Domhnall Gleeson (""Brooklyn"", ""Ex Machina"") almost unrecognizable to me as General Hux, mouthpiece to the First Order. Daisy Ridley and John Boyega both impress as the 'unknowns' in the cast, albeit with (particularly in the case of Ridley's Rey) a few rough acting edges in some of the dialogue that will smooth with age and fame.Rey is a wonderful female character at the heart of the film, the strongest role model for women in action films since Sigourney Weaver's Ripley in ""Alien"". Athletic and tough, yet still showing a feminine grace and beauty in her Greek goddess-inspired apparel.It's also fabulous to see the original trilogy cast again, all older and nicely wizened, with Han Solo (Harrison Ford) being delightfully crusty and only Carrie Fisher's Leia perhaps suggesting that even with all the high tech that existed back then, they still hadn't quite mastered cosmetic surgery. Even the inside of the Millennium Falcon – queue audience cheer as the rust-bucket hoves into view – looks like its had a chip-fat fire or ten too many and could do with the hire of a steam cleaner. (And Abrams judiciously resists the urge to lens flare it, which is a plus!) What a treat also that the 'hidden' originals of Anthony Daniels (C3PO), Kenny Baker (R2D2) and Peter Mayhew (Chewbacca) all had the chance to reprise their roles again. They are joined in the ""I was in Star Wars not that you'd know it"" club by Lupita Nyong'o (from ""12 Years a Slave"" and ""Non-Stop"") as a sort of alien commune leader (reminiscent to me of The Simpson's Professor Frink), Mo-cap expert Andy Serkis (""The Lord of the Rings""; ""Planet of the Apes"") as supreme leader Snoke and the very lofty Gwendeline Christie (""Game of Thrones"") as the stormtrooper Captain Phasma.In fact it's almost impossible to criticize this film. It's as near a thing to perfection as I could imagine. It has obviously been lovingly crafted by people (and a lot of British production talent) that clearly had to pinch themselves that THEY were getting to work on a Star Wars film. The script by Abrams, Lawrence Kasdan and Michael Arndt zings along like an express train, with some great snatches of appropriate humour delivering laugh out loud moments. It certainly avoids a lot of the cheesy lines that were one of the few things you could criticize the previous Star Wars masterpiece ""The Empire Strikes Back"" for.John Williams delivers a stonkingly powerful score, with new themes for the new characters mixed with a nostalgia-filled return to the classic old themes, all deserving of a proper listen-to via the soundtrack album.After this experience, I'm personally sorry that Abrams is not doing the next one too: Colin Trevorrow (""Jurassic World"") has a challenge on his hands and a high-bar to reach.I feared Abrams might make a cack-up of Jar Jar proportions with this one, but I am truly delighted to be proved wrong. I predict that all fans of Star Wars of whatever age will love it, and wish that Hamill, Fisher and Ford would all go on to star in Episodes VIII and IX. Fantastic cinema. Go see it, and ideally before any spoilers emerge."
ID_100116	I spent last half an hour reading first few dozens of reviews on IMDb. Every single one was bashing with rate from 1/10 (big majority) to maximum 4/10. Still, average rating on that same IMDb is 8,1. Conclusion - movie is not at all that bad as they wanna show it. Haters are minority, but all haters have unbearable urge to bash everything they lay their eyes on, while the rest of us who liked the movie and who are in huge majority, mostly do not care to write reviews. To be completely honest, most of their arguments against this movie are hard as a rock, it's all facts, but the final result is not bad movie at all. Haters claim this is is plagiarism of original trilogy. True, movie has one of the most appalling lack of originality I have ever seen, but I prefer to consider it reboot of the original trilogy rather than plagiarism. Yes, they made it to get some more money on old fame and, yes, everything in it we saw before, but still it is nicely done and very entertaining movie. Maybe I fell on targeted nostalgia they cunningly used, but I really really enjoyed this show from the beginning to the very end. I simply loved it.7,5/10
ID_100117	"THE FIRST MOVIE THAT I DEMANDED MY MONEY BACK--AND I GOT IT!There are 10 million things wrong with this movie. They totally Disney-fied it--TFA belongs on Disney XD after Power Rangers, not on the silver screen. The entire internet is now nothing but spam bots and sell-outs praising an Episode 4 raping better titled as ""A New Hype"".This will go down as the worst Stars Wars until 8 and 9 come out. I remember when TPM came out people were crying--literally full-on tear-streaming--and that had Liam Neeson, Ewan McGregor, and Darth Maul. This movie stars random unknowns confused about whether they are on stage doing a play (white girl, Ridley) or a Nickelodeon comedy-skit (black guy, Boyega).Spoiler Free Breakdown on the Suck-age:1 - No cool villains at all: only STUPID INCOMPETENT Disney villains. 2 - No heroes: only ultra lucky/randomly successful Disney bumblers. 3 - No story from Ep 6: it's like Vader/Luke/Han retired of old age after Ep 5 and The Emperor is just still around but he got senile and really stupid-looking. 4 - No writing: Everything randomly happens and appears. The characters even have jokes about it. 5 - No more Sci-Fi: Nothing makes even George-Lucas sense. Pointless machines (one the size of a planet), no advancement in technology. No A-wings, B-wings, Y-wings, freighters, command ships, or cool looking shuttles. If anything they went backwards from Ep 5, not forward 30 years from Ep 6. 6 - Original trio never on screen together: Not even 1 second or a worthy flashback. No one even knows them as a trio. It's like Episodes 4-6 were just a completely dried-out/stale inside joke between granny Leia and Han. 7 - The Force doesn't make any sense: Doesn't work like any of the other movies. Apparently it now just randomly makes you win or lose--nothing to train or study. Sometimes you have it, other times you don't.8 - Lots of poor CGI: THEY LIED. 9 - The worst lightsabre battles of the series: Prepare for blurry/eye-hurting jump-cuts slapped together. 10 - Stormtroopers aren't elite--in fact they aren't even soldiers anymore: Many of them now spend their time doing random chores you thought the Navy peons or a captured slave or droid would do.It was so bad it would have been better if Lucas remade Howard the Duck starring Jar Jar--literally. I came out of the theatre wishing the movie had starred/dir. by Kevin Smith and was called The Revenge of Cockknocker.Cockknocker is levels cooler than everything in this movie put together--and I hate Kevin Smith and that movie (Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back).At this point, only a full retcon like Wolverine: Origins (an ironically vastly-superior movie compared to this Jar Jar Abrams turd) can resurrect the franchise.Star Wars is DEAD."
ID_100118	The return of Star Wars has been long-awaited, and it's finally here. With so much hype surrounding the film, there was no-doubt some extreme nervousness about the turnout of the film. But put your nerves at ease, because J.J. and his team have delivered very solid, flawed, but exciting Sci-Fi adventure.There are many aspects to consider when critiquing this film: humour, story, performances, characters and technical achievements - which pinpoint the film's highs and lows.There is a surprising amount of humour in Episode VII. Each character, both old and new, appear to have a comic value of some degree. Han Solo and Chewbacca are their usual gimmicky, humorous selves. The charisma of our new little droid, BB-8 also adds to the fun energy of the movie. Some may argue that there is too much humour in this film to take seriously. Personally, I found it only added to the quality of the film, after all, what is Star Wars without humour? J.J. and Lawrence have done a fantastic job writing the movie. The story is refreshing, with plenty of nostalgic moments (and unfortunately some cliché ones too). The premise of The Force Awakens is definitely one of the most intriguing aspects of the film. After the crawl fades, the action begins, and it doesn't let down! We are greeted to all of the new characters in their seemingly inter-connected lives. We get a bit of an insight into their current lifestyles, motivations and even some of their ambitions. The plot is so event-focused that it demands total awareness and perhaps even repeat viewings. In my opinion, I feel there has been a little too much crammed in to this movie at once, however the unfolding events appear to be leading into what will hopefully be a very exciting sequel.Episode VII introduces many new characters, from Finn and Rey to Poe and Kylo Ren. It's so refreshing and exciting to see the new replace the old, as our next chapter in the Star Wars saga begins. Performance wise, all actors portray their characters well. It's honestly nothing spectacular, but it appears each actor is well invested in their character. Although something to note are our new leads, played by John Boyega (Finn) and Daisy Ridley (Rey). Both present us with fairly simple characters, experiencing a sudden turn in their casual lives. This is quite reminiscent of many characters from this film's predecessors. We'll also be looking forwards to Adam Driver in future, who plays the menacing and somewhat awkward character of Kylo Ren.In technical aspects, The Force Awakens holds up very well indeed. It's so beautifully crafted, and it's clear that this movie was made with lots of dedicated and hardworking hands. The visual effects are what you'd expect from J.J. Abrams - they're big, beautiful and seamless. There's a great balance between makeup prosthetics, practical effects and CGI. It's a welcome balance to the new trilogy. Other technicalities, such as cinematography, sound effects, film editing etc. are all pretty much flawless in their execution. However the most exciting technical aspect of the film I found was John Williams' score. Yes, there are a lot of reprising themes from the original trilogy, however there is a notable amount of new content. Perhaps nothing is quite so memorable as the opening credits music, or say the 'Imperial March', however the new themes are quite sweeping - a great addition to the Star Wars universe.Conclusively, I believe J.J. Abrams has got it right. Yes the film is definitely flawed, but he ultimately delivers us what we need - a fun, action packed, intense and humorous entry into the Star Wars universe. I wish I had payed more attention to the previous films so I could fairly rank them against The Force Awakens, however I can definitely agree that this is a very solid piece of entertainment. When watching this movie, go in with an open mind, but stay alert. The premise will have you on edge and the following revelations definitely deserve your attention! This is indeed a force to be reckoned with.9/10
ID_100119	Star Wars Episode 7: The Force Awakens is the long-awaited seventh installment in the Star Wars film series and the beginning of the brand new Sequel Trilogy. Without giving away too much, I'll say that it is the best Star Wars movie since The Empire Strikes Back. It does everything right that the Prequel Trilogy did wrong.Normally, I would write a synopsis here. This time I refuse to do so. There are so many secrets and twists in this film that revealing the smallest plot point could potentially spoil the entire movie. All I will say is that it takes place 30 years after the Original Trilogy. I will leave it at that.The whole film felt like a breath of fresh air to anyone wanting to see a new Star Wars movie. Almost everything in this film worked really well. The characters, new and old, lent themselves to so many memorable moments and even some great comic relief. Unlike the Prequels, which focused too much on politics, this film focuses more on the action and story. J. J. Abrams has proved that the Star Wars series is in the right hands at Disney, he was the perfect choice as the film's director. I already can't wait for Episode 8.I rate it a very high 9.5/10, the same rating as Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope.
ID_100120	Whoever gave this a negative review clearly lost their minds or just doesn't have much going on upstairs to begin with. This film is exactly what all actual Star Wars fans wanted it to be.Daisy Ridley has a very successful career ahead of her and this film was a great way to kick start that. Oscar Isaac was just the right man for his role and Ford, as usual, was BRILLIANT.JJ did an amazing job in directing this project and the visual effects were as good as they get. If you liked the originals then you're gonna LOVE this.Anything else I can't reveal with giving away something or the other, but I'm gonna bet that if you loved Star Wars than you BETTER watch it or you'll honestly regret it.
