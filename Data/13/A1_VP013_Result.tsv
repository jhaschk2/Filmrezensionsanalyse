ID_100361	7	Let me keep this to the essentials.Is it worth seeing? Yes.Will it change your life? No.Is it better than Eps I-III? Yes.Is it better than Eps IV-VI? No.What's particularly awesome? Han Solo, super fast pace, retro chic, sound effects.What's particularly lame? Kylo Ren, British accents galore, lazy story, too much deja-vu.Totally worth the ticket and tons of fun if you don't expect the time of your life.
ID_100362		"J J Abrams (with the blessing of Disney) has manages to reunite the band, but fails to awaken the force. His sence of pacing has the rushed feel of the television world, as if he thought he were making a one hour pilot. He has somehow managed to edit out almost the entire story leaving nothing but action scenes behind. Aquaintances and friendships are made between characters in such absurdly rushed fashion that it makes you yearn for the more zen pace of Lucas' writing.Kudos for the removal of all the racial stereotypes. There are no Jar Jars or Wattos here, but then again there is little in the way of imagination either. We've seen everything before, all the characters, weapons, costumes, fight scenes. They simply do not stand out in an age that is over saturated with CG characters. The one highlight in the 'animated cast' is the supreme leader Snoke seated at his throne in the shadows. If nothing else he may be the tallest speaking part in the Star Wars universe.The movie rests very much on the shoulders of two new youths Rei (Daily Ridley) and Finn (John Boyega). Both of them have the kind of Tom Cruise hyperdrive that make them essentially excellent video game characters; Two bodies who can never do a thing wrong regardless of the circumstances. In one scene Rey first demonstrates that she can use the force and pulls off a trick so easily that it insults all the long days that Luke spent training with Yoda. Finn meanwhile gets to wield the Skywalker Lightsaber, long before he has earned the right to even touch it. (This is a crown jewel in the treasury of classic film props for god sake)What this moment demostrated to me is the that film does not really have much respect for all that is sacred in Star Wars, it merely showcases the pieces. Sure we have Han and Leia back but their so their funtion is mostly plot advancement. They have a short exchange which hints at some inner demons regarding events that took place somewhere between episode 6 and this, a missed chance for a good prologue scene."
ID_100363	10	"""42"" unhelpful votes, there is cheating going on here. Don't mistake continuity of story and universe with ""reboot or rehash"" - This is a story that continues on from the end of Return of the Jedi"". We are not worried about The Force being explained anymore, we don't care - It's a mystery and back to being a mystery. It starts with a simple enough premise: The Empire was defeated and their end Death Star obliterated, but as always, in fiction as in true life, when old bad guys are killed off, new bad guys take their place.This is not a universe that is ""in the same condition as it was in Eps IV, V, and VI"" - As there is a new republic, there is also a new group of imperialists and fascists that want to tear it down. It's happening in the US this very day, so this is nothing new.I suspect these negative reviews are just the spewings and ramblings of anti-JJ Abrams shills, doing the same as they did for Star Treks I and II. Because there are NO kiddie elements in this new Star Wars, it is a story aimed at long term fans of the franchise and it hits with a bullseye. What surprises me, is ALL of the 1-star reviews say EXACTLY the same thing. Because they were not written by 100 guys, but by ONE guy AS ""100"" guys. The main thing here is ""Where is Luke Skywalker"" - And both bad guys and good guys want to know the answer to this. So do We. These include some of the old regulars, plus a new bad guy who wears a Helmet that looks like the Ugly Narc-Alien from Episode IV, who narced on Hans Solo to Imperial Storm Troopers and particularly Jabba the Hut. In an early confrontation in this episode, this duck faced guy takes out Max Von Sydow who indicates this person came from the Good side of the Force.So to me it's just continuity, as there are Jedi who followed Luke and his mentor Obi-Wan, any new recruit that goes down the Dark Side ends up doing Darth Vaderish things, like killing Off a whole school of Jedi Kids.As in life with often repeated scenarios, that keep on repeating over and over, this is just the same in the Star Wars universe. I'm not worried about that, what's important here is ""Does this film play out like original Star Wars""? And yes, it does.And although this film includes people from Eps 4, 5, and 6, this is a new story, and so there are two new players, a girl, who is waiting on a crummy sand planet, and a storm trooper, who turns away from his programming because he wants something better. And there is something about this Kid, do we know *his* father?The imagery is pure original Star Wars. The gadgets, the Droids, the Crashed Imperial Destroyers. New and Old Aliens, in new and old Bars.I very much wanted to know who this girl was, and I very much wanted to know about this kid who walked away from being a storm trooper. In the Meantime, it was great to see Han, Chewie, and Leia, who have scars of age and experience. At one time, they were the young ones who had the responsibility laid on them, in this episode, it is the girl and the boy. Because in real life it is always the young choosing to do good, who have long term effects, who save Nations in some cases. It's generational, the old guard passes it on the the new guard. If you live in this world, you're feeling the change of the guard - As the old song says.That's what this episode is, although there is a major victory, it is at major cost. And although the old Empire had built two powerful Death Stars, those were nothing compared to a new threat. It's a death star on steroids. So some ask, why make new Death Stars? Why have one in this movie? Because, it's the limited thinking of The Imperialists and Fascists. Because they always go back to comfortable norms for weapons design- In their Supreme Leader's small thinking, another huge planet sized weapon with a huge GUN.I saw this in IMax, in 3D, and I was impressed with how each 3D gag was well thought out and well placed. My brother kept trying to reach out and touch the tip of the Imperial Destroyer. A film shot in 3D has to look good also in 2D, and this does, in the IMax theater I could occasionally pull off my glasses and see a 2D Scene, and the composition in 2D was just as good. I'm not really a fan of 3D films, you can't really call them films anymore, as they are made on all digital medium. But for this episode, it worked well.In Lucas's overblown Eps I II and III, the CGI was over the top and blatantly CGI. IN this film, the CGI blends with the practical elements so that you absolutely cannot tell which is which. And also in Eps I II and III we have a multitude of scenes which are boring discussions explaining the force, mainly people sitting on couches talking. That, to me is about exciting as eating a plate of Tripe! I guarantee you, you will NOT see any Jedi sitting on couches talking in this one. Or Senators, or Sith Lords. This film is action from start to finish- about 2 and a half hours worth.And after walking out after the last scene and the film credits, there is no way in hades or Tattoine, that this will not have sequels. And this episode deserves to have sequels. And I for one cannot wait for those to come out!"
ID_100364	8	Although I'm not a great fan, with time I really became obsessed about this universe, and that movie is one of the bests, they have all the references, the olds characters (more evolves) and new ones pretty well work, the visual effects is nostalgic and so much better also, the story is totally understandable, and you really will enjoy this adventure.
ID_100365	10	Isn't a little suspicious that a movie that has 95% approval by critics and 93% approval by fans at RottenTomatoes, a 81 score at Metacritics and a 8.7 overall score at IMDb has so much 1/10 stars reviews at the IMDb user reviews section? This section has been invaded by trolls. No doubt about it.I've watched this movie 3 times already and people always leave the theater with huge smiles in their faces. The Force Awakens is all about enjoying the ride â€” and what a ride! JJ Abrams achieved an impossible mission: he honored the past by setting the ground for the future without pissing off hardcore Star Wars fans.The pace of the movie and the witty dialogs makes the story fly. Much better than Return of the Jedi and (I dare say) the original Star Wars, The Force Awakens is all fans and non- fans have been waiting for.
ID_100366		As someone who's a fan of the original trilogy (Episodes 4-6. I never saw the more recent prequels nor have any plan to) but who's not obsessed or in complete love with them, I went with this with good enough expectations but not expecting to be blown away. Those expectations were entirely met. Like the original Star Wars films (mostly A New Hope, which was always my favorite) this has a complete sense of fun and energy that vibrates not just with the action (and there's a lot) but with the characters and their interactions. In comparison to most Hollywood blockbuster, it's pretty standard in its structure. There's nothing here that is any huge risk, but then again none of the Star Wars films were ever incredibly challenging or unformulaic. Like the originals, this one just has such a positive energy and its formula completely works. They did such a great job casting the new characters, and in particular Daisy Ridley and especially Adam Driver (who steals every scene he is in) do some great work here. I don't think J.J. Abrams has brought anything distinctive or different in style than the originals, but I don't think that was his aim at all. He does a great job handling everything as a package, and that is no easy feat. In a time where Hollywood is filled with unimaginative, repetitive, dull blockbusters (Hello Marvel!) this joins Mad Max: fury Road as really standing apart from the flock, even if it's different to Fury Road in that it follows the formula a lot more. But if it works, don't break it, and this is surely one of the most purely entertaining, and lovable, films of the year. The praise is deserved.
ID_100367	9	"Greetings from Lithuania.""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" (2015) is a blast off entertainment from start till finish. I'm not a huge Star Wars fan, so i kinda wasn't in the whole hype surrounding this sequel, but nevertheless i was also caught but all the fuzz, saw the trailers more then once and was waiting and wanting for this movie. I saw this movie with couple of friend who are a true Star Wars fans, and they were a bit disappointed by this movie. They complained that is made not much sense as a sequel, and maybe wasn't even true sequel, but from my point of view, it did many things that a sequel, which budget is 200 000 000$ and much of the new franchise's right owners future is at stake, right. It plays safe in terms of story, it is visually stunning movie (Oscar award without doubts), features tons of action, plenty of very good humour, returning iconic characters, some moving scenes and combine it with some nostalgic moments - this is a winner. Overall, as not a Star War fan i give this movie 10/10. I do believe, that if i would have been a ""fanboy"", score would have been lover. It has almost everything that a fun and great popcorn entertainment must have - simple and sharp characters, tons of action, superb effects, great humour, interesting (even if not very menacing villains), involving story and a sense of nostalgic to a previous movies if you have seen them. Next movie is scheduled for 2017. Can't wait."
ID_100368	8	"It's finally here - something that some fans have been waiting 32 years for! (Although the last theatrically-released Star Wars film, 'The Clone Wars', only came out seven years ago). Since I wasn't born until after 'Return of the Jedi' and grew up watching them on VHS and am a pretty big fan, the sequel trilogy (as opposed to the prequel trilogy) and 'The Force Awakens' has long been hoped for.OK, let's see if I can do a vague storyline with no spoilers... 30 years after the Battle of Endor, Han (Ford) is the first 'original' we're reintroduced to - well, technically Stormtroopers are, followed by the Millennium Falcon. But first, we meet Poe (Issac), an X-Wing pilot for ""the Resistance"" (the new Rebel Alliance); BB8, a ball-like droid; Finn (Boyega), a former Stormtrooper; and Rey (Ridley), a scavenger, barely surviving on the desert world of Jakku (which plays a role in the 'Lost Stars' novel, well worth a read!). BB8 holds some important data and needs to get it to Leia (Fisher), before the ""First Order"" (the new Empire) and Kylo Ren (Driver) get it, so they can all find Luke (Hamill). The only ones missing are Lando & Wedge.It feels like a lot has changed, but also not much at all - it truly feels like the original Star Wars universe, with plenty of new aliens, spaceships and droids, but also plenty of old ones. Abrams has definitely nailed the tone, with plenty of adventure and zest, and also some humour and drama. The pace rarely sags and it doesn't feel like two & a bit hours, but nor does it try to cram too much in. It's not exactly a carbon copy of 'A New Hope', but definitely borrows a lot of themes from it.Some questions are answered, but are lot are left unanswered, so the anticipation remains for the next films. While the film is definitely a great movie - and far better than any of the prequels - I sometimes didn't feel as if as much was at stake as it was in the originals and a few things didn't sit 100% right, also probably a by-product of my high expectations. Still, Ridley & Boyega are both very good to watch and valuable additions, and Driver's intriguing - I look forward to watching their characters grow in Episodes VIII and IX."
ID_100369	6	"First of all, I have to say like mostly everyone I loved the new characters especially Rey and Finn. I think they'll be a great addition to the SW universe and I'm looking forward to where future films take them. After the first time I watched this movie on opening night, I was ecstatic. I left the theater with a huge grin on my face because I knew that JJ Abrams made a movie that was better than any of the Lucas-directed prequels. Unfortunately after seeing it a second time, I noticed the flaws A LOT more because now I could focus more on the plot and pick up on anything I may have missed the first time. As many have already pointed out, at times this film is very similar to Star Wars Episode 4: A New Hope. Sometimes it feels TOO similar to the point where it just gets distracting and you can't help but feel the writers/director just wanted to play on the audience's nostalgia. I would compare it to a used car salesman trying to sweet talk me into buying a car he knows is in bad shape but plays on my emotions to get me to buy it. Similarly, JJ tries to play on the audience's love of the original trilogy to somehow make us forget that really nothing much happens in this movie. By the end of it I was left wanting more and not in a good way but more of a ""that's it?"" kind of way. This movie's primary purpose was to introduce us to this new group of characters and get us to love them so that we buy tickets to see the next films. It succeeds in doing so, but fans of Star Wars deserve a lot more than that."
ID_100370	9	Star Wars: The Force Awakens is an outstanding movie with a very well developed plot and a stellar cast. There's no denying how big the hype for this film really was, and it made me quite nervous as my love for the series was setting the bar high, but I wasn't one bit disappointed. The magic of Star Wars is back, the magic that I have always complained was missing from the prequel trilogy. The tone is similar to A New Hope in which it sets up a new adventure, beautifully, and it will leave you wanting more. Of course, with a film as anticipated as this, you are going to find flaws, and the Force Awakens does have a few significant ones, the one that bothered me the most was Andy Serkis's role, his character was confusing to say the least. He didn't feel like he belonged in this universe, it felt more like a Harry Potter character. Hopefully they will establish him and make some sense of it in future films, but for now I am left scratching my head at all his scenes. R2D2's character arch in the film is very messy, I will not reveal anything, all I will say is that the writers did not spoon feed us any information on what was going on with him. Lastly, one of my biggest pieces of criticism, Kylo Ren is not a likable villain, not like Darth Vader was. He does not have the kind of traits Vader, as well as Darth Maul and Count Dooku, had that made us root for them at times, with Ren you want him to be defeated as soon as you are made aware of his motives, lots of villains are like this, but with Star Wars I have come to expect more likable bad guys.The cast is outstanding. The new members, Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, Adam Driver, Domhnall Gleeson, among many others, are brilliant new additions to the franchise, their characterization in their respective roles is fantastic, they are all top notch performers. The returning members are all a delight to see in their iconic roles, I was skeptical about Carrie Fisher and Mark Hamill returning as Leia and Luke, but it was as if they never left, very natural. Anthony Daniels and Peter Mayhem will also bring a smile to your face. My favourite part of the entire movie had to be Harrison Ford. There are many brilliant characters in this series but Han Solo will always stand as my favourite, mainly because of how well Ford portrays him, and this movie is no exception. He slips back in to the role perfectly and did not seem one bit nervous, even with this being his first time playing the character in 32 years. The moment he is on screen you can feel that he is back in character, and he steals every single scene. Action packed, intense and compelling, Star Wars: The Force Awakens can not be missed by any fan of the series, and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a good action, adventure or sci-fi film. A new threat arises thirty years after the events of Return of the Jedi, but a new group of heroes may be able to stop them, with the help of some familiar faces. Best Performance: Harrison Ford
ID_100371	7	"I went to the cinema last night and here's my personal review:In general: None of the characters is getting developed during the plot. All of them are fully explained and equipped with all their attitude and feature sets within the first five minutes of appearance.Kylo Ren, the villain: isn't threatening at all. I feel sad for a youngster who's apparently been hanging around with the wrong guys and is gotten weird in his puberty. But I'm not impressed. He's just a nervous kid who has never learned to control his temper, angrily destroying things in his room when he gets upset. To me he's more like Biff Tannen in the ""Back to the Future"" franchise.Rey, the girl: is just as stubborn, insolent and ludicrously high gifted as all movie heroins are. She's so scrawny she can hardly hold a gun, yet she's winning every fight easily. Oh my god.... Well, at least she PILOTS like a woman ;)Flinn, the guy: is stupid and clumsy. I wonder how he survived his time as a soldier. And I wonder why I should be continuously watching him failing over and over again. I feel sad for him.The girl and the guy: I guess Disney wanted to turn the role model wheel 180Â°, making the skinny young girl a fighter and the fighter a foolish young girl. For me such absurdity is utterly hard to watch without holding and shaking my disenchanted head.Lor San Tekka, Max von Sydow: Why is he, the perfect Obi-Wan Kenobi character successor, in the movie only for about five minutes?--Why is every film aimed at 12 year old children nowadays? Why didn't the creatures in the carrier hurt someone?Most of the excitement, suspense and sobriety in a movie comes from characters not talking. But all of the characters in the movie - just - didn't - stop - talking!No ambiance or mute suspense scenes are depicted whatsoever. No fade or wipe as been applied, too. So there's no chance whatsoever to get John William's excellent score to interact with the audience.Everyone was acting so fast and nervously. Gee, I felt like being in a nursery from all the unnecessary stupidity and cheer that's been said.What's so great with Chewbacca's crossbow which Han Solo didn't see earlier in all these years?Everyone in the movie is talking and behaving too nervously and fast. The only ones with a great timing were Han Solo - and Snoke in particular.The Chewbacca character is giving a plain stupid idiot. Just like the Finn character does.BB-8 is behaving like a little dog. No cleverness whatsoever. He's unnecessary from the beginning. It would have been more reasonable to put the USB stick into a box and hide it in the sands than to introduce the BB-8 character for this.I would have preferred if a Muppet would have been used for playing Maz Kanata. These CGI characters just don't have soul. I bet no child would like to have a Maz Kanata puppet in their bed.Why is the chess board (Dejarik) on board the Millennium Falcon playing all of a sudden - WITHOUT players?--And here's my review to the horrible German translation of the flick:""I'm a Stormtrooper"" has been translated into ""ich bin ein Sturmtruppler"" - Huh? ""Sturmtruppler""??? Really? So the German translators didn't know how to translate a German word into German?? In English this would be like calling him a ""Stormtroopling""! Gee!! ... Who came up with that idea?? Why didn't they let him say something reasonable like: ""ich gehÃ¶re zu den Sturmtruppen"" which may be translated as ""I'm belonging to the shock troops""?!?Same for ""The First Order"": They translated it into ""Die erste Ordnung"" which sounds just like ""The First Orderliness"" in German. Gee!! What did they think this is? Isn't the house cleaning company nearby called like this? I hardly believe the director of the German version really knew what he/she was doing... A more appropriate translation into German would have been something like ""Das neue Regime"".It must have been nitwits who did the translation. Didn't they know that the Empire is a allegory to the Third Reich? Come one, guys, this isn't Lord of the Rings!Moreover, I don't know about Kylo Ren's English voice, but the German voice has been badly set. Too much intonation, he is talking too quickly. His voice is just too vivid and nervous to be evil. Given that voice, wouldn't he be better off singing when he tortures others? (After all, it's a Disney flick, isn't it?)Same for the silvery ""Stormtroopling"". He's a ""she"" - and she's talking with a high pitched girl's voice! Urgh!! I couldn't hold myself laughing when she'd be giving orders.Not to mention the voice of Maz Kanata. She's got the voice of a young woman! But does she look like one?? To me she rather seemed and felt like a female Yoda. And that's what I would have expected from her voice: The voice from someone having a voice like one of the Golden Girls actresses. Or Roseanne's as it is now.--One positive thing: There *really* is a great deal of true hardware and makeup done in the movie. And it was great to see the Millennium Falcon interior with all the traditional switches and levers - and WITHOUT a touch screen!However, the amount of CGI in the movie is still 99 % compared to real hardware/makeup.--I'm very much looking forward to get a hand on the DVD. As soon as I get it I will cut all the hooey and girlish stuff out, add length by slowing down some scenes and create my own grown-up version of the flick."
ID_100372	7	"*SPOILERS* The film alone is watchable, although there is certainly nothing remarkable about it whatsoever. I wont be re-seeing it. A major flaw with the movie is the rather poor story, which includes the usual Abrams plot holes and zero subtleties which are what hold peoples imagination as he seems on a mission that the everything be dumbed down to the lowest common denominator. That the plot actually shares many parts nearly identically with SW ANH cannot be denied, and it was probably done intentionally as a slight tribute/""re-dedication for a new generation"" - oh yay!hooray for nostalgia!... or rather, how about a new story?! Character development: none. Yes, everyone knows they can't give the audience all the information, but really that lack of information on the back story in this film was bizarre and off-putting. The pacing: disjointed. Completely missing is the ""Star Wars feel"" with the intense battle of the Dark and Light side, that even the much-maligned prequels still manage (see ""Duel of the Fates etc). Also, I cannot remember any of the soundtrack after seeing the movie - even the Phantom Menace featured unbelievable scores.Among the most unforgivable of the film are the plot holes that will even have the casual Star Wars fans in disbelief:Here are a few a can still remember: It's all well and good Disney and Abrams slapped the Star Wars fan base in the face by ""un-canonizing"" all of the Expanded Universe literature...but they can't use that excuse for this one -Luke Skywalker would never run away from a Sith that he is responsible for training, especially his nephew.-a ZERO-trained very powerful force user - just nope...I mean, even Anakin Skywalker had to train and there was a Force prophecy about him!-Non-force user non-clone storm trooper using a lightsaber for the first time rather spectacularly against a Sith trained by Luke Skywalker!-non-trained powerful force user, also a lightsaber novice, also manages to defeat a trained Sith lord...folks, do we remember SW ANH where Vader strikes down Obi Wan or SW TPM, where Darth Maul strikes down Qui Gon and almost defeats Obi Wan - yeah, Force Awakens lightsaber duels are a total insult to those... -Kylo Rens light saber not only looks like a joke, but it's design would actually lead to the saber's destruction during a duel as the perpendicular beams are emitted from nodes sticking out at the base of the main blade...ie. as soon as an opponents blade grinds down to the hilt it will be naturally directed to slicing into the lightsaber handle...and also nobody asked for a cheesy lightsaber...Small squadron of old beat up fighters beating an Armada - nopeHow does the resistance all of a sudden no where the weapon planet is? And why didn't they try to destroy it WAY before!!!Aside from the lead, she was pretty good, the acting was sub-par, especially the actor going on about imaginary complaints about a black Storm Trooper...(it was ironic HE was the one making the biggest deal about it!). His ""coming to morality"" killing the village scene nearly ruined the movie for me it was so bad - not only the acting but the 3 finger blood streak was also lame clichÃ© and looked really fake bad.Acting:7 CGI:7 Soundtrack:6 Script:5 Plot:5.5 Character Development:4 Pacing:4Who will bring balance to the Force now?"
ID_100373	8	"This is the movie ""you've all been waiting for"", a grand, classic early 80s Star Wars sequel complete with analogue grain, and the exact same music, credits, shots, battle sequences, characters, plot devices and themes.The movie also has some new spins, details and depth during the battle sequences, and luckily, it IS an emotionally powerful piece of drama, the third act is palpably effective.Is it worth seeing? Well, in the 35 years or whatever since Star Wars came to the screen, there's been a lot of developments in making stylized, fx-heavy violence and spaceship battles on screen, so the movie mostly relies on expensive modern production values that look convincingly like the original Star Wars universe. Also, the story beats happen faster, which in a sense rob depth of a fantasy series that didn't have much in the first place, and often the action sequences smack of frames and stand-offs from the old series.I DID SAY, however, that it has guts. The film feels real, and compelling, and has a sense of drama that relates to the real world, also its commendable that the film has a strong female lead and an African American dude is prominent throughout, although that's not in itself innovative in 2015, its still a nice idea to bring some diversity to the Star Wars franchise, also adds dramatic possibility, something George Lucas clearly had no grasp of in his ""prequel"" trilogy launched in the late nineties.Anyway, writing about Star Wars is a bit like ""dancing about architecture"" to borrow a Frank Zappa phrase on the role of critics, go see it: if you like Star Wars, you'll love this movie. Older viewers, or really anyone familiar with the early installations will occasionally wince at the fact that the movie is nearly entirely a clone of some sort - perhaps the first big reboot of a popular series that's really a note-for-note remake.Generally good acting though, and decent budget, as you'd expect from Disney/Lucasfilm megacorp."
ID_100374	10	"I guess like every fan of the ""Star Wars"" saga, I eagerly awaited this new movie, and was not disappointed (much). I waited long enough until the massive crowds died down enough that I could finally see the picture and not have to worry about sitting in a heavily crowded theater and being constantly distracted by everything that comes along with a large crowd.Alas, I was but one of five people at a 1:15 P.M. showing at my local theater.With the eagerly awaited 2015 ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens,"" I can say that ""Alias"" J.J. Abrams has fashioned a reasonable sequel to the original ""Star Wars"" trilogy that began in 1977 and ended in 1983, as well as the much-beleaguered prequel trilogy that began in 1999 and ended in 2005.The film is not the prequel trilogy and doesn't contain any of its silliness, but it falls short of the epic grandeur of the original trilogy. It's really somewhere in the middle, if you really want to think about it. But I guess, if we were to have a continuation of ""Star Wars"" following the conclusion of ""Return of the Jedi"" (1983), then this was it.This new film is very much a return to the tone and style of the original trilogy, and features a great many nods to those films, while still in other ways continuing the story.People, and George Lucas (creator of the ""Star Wars"" saga), have speculated for years that a follow-up to the original trilogy would be something like ""The Force Awakens,"" where a time after the conclusion of ""Return of the Jedi,"" we would return to many of the principal cast members and some new, fresh faces to the saga, as well.I wasn't disappointed, but aside from a few minor quibbles, this was a worthy entry into the ""Star Wars"" cinematic saga. I look forward to ""Episode VIII"" in a few years.10/10"
ID_100375	10	I have to say I liked the fact this film follows on from the originals and maintains some of its appeal. However there is a true lack of Originality. My first issue is that since Lucas has sold the rights to this, you can see this is a typical Disney style film. By selling out this franchise he has sacrificed a cult classic. The Villain Ren for example, has no evil appeal. He is a soft character and reminds me of a typical Harry Potter style Villain. When you look at characters such as Darth Vader and Darth Maul, this new guy is just weird teenager geek type character reminding me of the villain in KickAss, Red Mist. Secondly Disney is clearly aiming this movie at a younger generation age range 8-15. They are also more concerned with profits than widening the appeal to the masses. Thirdly they used a safe bet storyline rather than using any originality, they have used similar ideas concepts used in the Original Empire strikes back movie.I personally think the Prequels are quite good in comparison to this new generation Star Wars. Especially because I liked the Prequels Originality and new story lines, as well as a wider understanding of new planets in the wider galactic empire. With Force Awakens, be prepared to not feel the same surprise factors felt in all the previous Star Wars movies. On a more positive note, I like that a lot of the Original cast has made a comeback to recreate the epic that was created many decades ago. Apart from that, I hope Lucas found all that extra money worth it because Disney has robbed you man.
ID_100376	10	But that's what makes this J.J Abrams Star Wars movie so great. It borrowed heavily from the original trilogy, making us all feel like kids again and feeling nostalgic. It lays down the same groundwork, the same plots, and allows us to explore the same galaxies/ environments and settings for this galactic space drama for the upcoming sequels. Yet it introduces us to brand new characters that will carry this franchise forward to the new future of star wars.I love Daisey Ridley portrayal of Rey as a down on her luck scruffy scavenger who had a very tough upbringing being all alone and forced to survive based on instincts. I like John Boyega who provided a convincing portrayal of a storm trooper that has gone rogue and who have renounced the First Order evil ways. I like how Lupito animates the smuggler queen, Maz Kanata with her intelligence and yet warmth towards old friends and those in need. Overall the plot points are very similar to Star Wars: A New Hope and it plays out almost the same way except with less star ships? (Whats up with that?) It leaves me wanting more and leaves me with that warm fuzzy feeling of being back in my childhood and relieving that star wars grand story and setting again to be in a fantasy world. SO yes it is absolutely amazing and I loved every minute of it and i would highly recommend the movie to everyone.
ID_100377	6	This one gets lots of hate because it had a familiar story but it did its job and got me hyped for the next saga film. The big shocker is kinda sucky but I understood it from a three film narrative and character building. Sadly all of it was squandered in the end.
ID_100378	6	I rarely write reviews since I guess I am just too lazy at times. But Star Wars is perhaps my favorite franchise and this one kind of killed it for me. There is a trend going for Superhero movies and Marvel releases a bunch of them and have even been going for the minor characters now (Ant Man for example). I believe Disney said they were going to do something similar for Star Wars. So we have here a mash-up of some of the original series (4,5 and 6) with basically nothing new. Now if they had marketed this as a remade New Hope I would have nothing to complain but I was expecting a whole new movie. The common thing with most superhero movies is they get pretty high fan and critic ratings (aberrations being Green Lantern perhaps) and they always succeed in the box office. But the issue is Star Wars was much grander and more innovative. However,now it is all part of the same mold--- you feel good after watching it but it does never leave an impression. Thinking of the prequels, while Episode 1 was a bit bad but there were some redeeming moments---the journey through the underwater world, the pod race and the Maul vs Qui Gon fight. Attack of the clones made things complicated and I actually had to re-watch the whole 1st 3 parts to understand exactly what was happening. Political intrigue and Order 66. And it was great to see how different things were before the Dark Side took over. In this one, nothing seems different---what a disappointment. And it still gets a 8.9....Bleh On a separate note, this is also a very politically correct Star Wars, perhaps the first one which is so. Makes me think if we had any of Lucas' originals releasing now, how would critics and audiences have treated them?
ID_100379		"I know people hate the prequel films; who doesn't. I for one didn't hold Episode 3 in high regard either, but it was at least watchable, to a certain degree. I guess some are not as jaded and cynical as others, but to each his own. For a while, it seem that old magic of the OT couldn't be recaptured or restored to the rightful vision. It seem that Star Wars was doomed to be something of ridicule, rather than the cultural phenomenon that it once was; starting especially of course, with the first film to the last of the OT. But having said that, after coming from seeing TFA, I'm very pleased to report that the force is strong once again in the new film, Star Wars Episode 7: The Force Awakens!! Gone is the cringe-inducing dialog, gone is the stiff, wooden, mechanical acting of the prequels(though they had their moments, but ultimately,uneven)gone is the overuse of CGI without a purpose or support to the story. What is here is what the OT was all about. Well-written characters, superb and at times humorous dialog, great action scenes, but most importantly, a great plot. Without spoiling it, there are numerous twists and turns and even some Easter eggs thrown in for good measure, that while as to remind longtime fans, but surprisingly, add to the overall narrative and it makes the film equally coherent as well as entertaining; something the prequels never achieved despite the high quality production values in accordance with the visuals.Some old faces show up along with some new ones. Leia and the gang are back. It's a treat to see Han Solo again, now with a cynical and world-weary outlook after the music stopped; figuratively speaking. The lead character, played by John Boyega, is both effectively acted and wholly convincing as a former Stormtrooper who does a complete 180 in his place in the galaxy and for better or worse, it's very fun to watch. Daisy Ridley was good as Rey, but I'd hoped to see a little more of her. But I was fascinated by Kylo Ren. Not only does he look imposing, but also menacing as the new Sith Lord on the block, with shadowy and ominous Supreme Leader Snoke, to back him up in their evil path to universal conquest of the galaxy.Sure some of the dialog is hammy and at times corny, as well as some gaps in logic, but that's what to be expected of Star Wars. Why some hold the OT over this film is beyond me,but I guess some people are not satisfied with what this film has to offer.The only gripe I have is while that some scenes are nice and homage the original trilogy, the film-makers played it a little too safe; not offering more new and unexpected, not being bold enough or try new things. Though this implies that they don't want to repeat the same mistakes as the prequel films, they could've flexed their muscles a little more and go for something more epic and grander than having to rely on homage to what was already established before.So in conclusion, this is a very well-made and solid film and although veterans of the series may not view it in the same light as the OT, Some,like me, takes a fresh approach. The force is strong again with this one. Hopefully the next film will be bolder, darker, and more daring than ever before."
ID_100380	10	I'm not going to say much about this outstanding sequel film, but this Episode 7 alone rips the last three apart with the force! LOL!The last three were pretty good, but this one Jedi crushed em all! I can't wait for episode 8! A mash up on the classic film and the new ones, which in turn is absolutely amazing!!The cast were phenomenal!Story and action are perfect!Im not a big fan but i think i am now!Definitely getting this on blu-ray!
ID_100381	8	The Force Awakens is better than all of the prequel trilogy movies. It has a lot of scenes that are similar to A New Hope. That doesn't effect the movie in a negative manner but boosts the audiences interest in it. The characters are amazing and the reveals are brilliant. They make X wing pilots cool and bring a whole new take on the story that does a great job at continuing the story from the original trilogy. I felt a lot of emotion watching this and am glad that a new generation will be introduced to Star Wars in such an amazing way. I grew up watching the prequel trilogy and it did its job at hooking the next generation on the Star Wars saga. This sequel trilogy will continue to add a new generation to this saga.
ID_100382	6	I'll start by saying I'm far from being a 'Star Wars' fanatic, or for that matter even really a fan. I happen to have seen all the movies to date and can appreciate them for what they are, but they are not really my preferred cup of tea. Hell, it took me almost 12 months to get around to seeing this entry into the series. All that said, I was still a little bit disappointed by 'Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens' simply because I expected more. I expected more in the way of a complex story and I expected more in the way of new characters. 'Kylo Ren' really didn't do it for me as the main villain. Obviously he had huge shoes to fill the terms of 'Darth Vadar' (this is even touched on in the movie), but I still feel like a better job could have been done. Also the story, while pleasantly easy to follow, felt like it was lacking in creativity. When your come to a 'Star Wars' movie you're prepared for a little bit of complexity.What I did really enjoy was the pacing of the film. It has a 136 minute run time and yet it feels like your standard 90 minute film, because it just flies by. When the credits rolled I remember thinking to myself moments before that there must be about 30 minutes to go. Daisy Ridley also immensely impressed me as the main protagonist. She was likable, charismatic and impressive in the action scenes. The only work-on for her before the next film would be her line delivery at times comes across a little fumbled. That shouldn't be too hard to fix.It's hard for me to guess how true 'Star Wars' fanatics are going to feel about this film, but I can tell you that for average folk like myself it's a watchable experience, but not a lot more.
ID_100383	9	"This review of ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" will be necessarily brief, for fear of spoilers. And when I say ""fear of spoilers,"" I really do mean FEAR of spoilers. There are people out there who will burn your house down if you ruin this long-awaited film's surprises.I really liked it. I would somewhat grudgingly give it a 9 out of 10, as I can't match the sheer ardor its global legions of fans. (Yes, ""Star Wars"" was a big part of my childhood, but I have more or less gotten over it. I read last night, for example, that filmmaker Kevin Smith actually cried upon stepping aboard the Millennium Falcon when he visited the set; I am not quite as nostalgic as that.)In short, it absolutely succeeds as a fun space fantasy, and recaptures the spirit of the original ""Holy Trilogy."" It easily surpasses the much-maligned prequels on nearly every level, including screen writing, acting and special effects. The predominance of practical effects over those that are exclusively digital make this movie's universe feel ""real"" and ""lived in.""We finally have relatable characters again who sound real, and who can invite viewer sympathy. The dramatic interaction among our newer heroes and returning icons is both logical and emotionally involving. I was surprised at how well this movie handled the passing of the torch. It was a kind of skilled storytelling that was almost entirely absent from the last three films. And the special effects were top notch.My only mild quibbles might reflect a greater degree of objectivity that you might hear from someone who is not a raging fan of the series. This film so closely parallels the original ""Star Wars"" (1978) that at times it started to feel like a remake. Were the similarities in structure, characters, plot points, planets and villains all an intentional homage? I suggest that our bad guys here, for example, sometimes feel interchangeable with those of past ""Star Wars"" films. I want to say more, but can't, because of spoilers. Am I the only person who noticed these things?I also submit that, like a few other ""Star Wars"" movies, our characters are rendered with little depth, with sparse information about their skills, motivations, backgrounds or ideosyncrasies. The dialogue is thin. Consider lines like ""He's my friend!"" and ""Because it's the right thing to do."" And we are presented with no information why the speaker here is so noble, when others are not. Even if the screen writing here is better than the prequels, it's still not Tennessee Williams.It's all very forgivable, I guess, just so long as the viewer remembers that they're sitting down to an installment in a film franchise originally intended for young people. It's kid stuff. It's really, really good kid stuff, but it's kid stuff. (Don't burn my house down!)And the reason I chose a 9 rating instead of an 8 was primarily the enjoyment I got from seeing familiar faces. The return of our icons was surprisingly well depicted and, if you loved ""Star Wars"" as a kid, then that should be enough to make this a ""must-see"" movie."
ID_100384	6	The Force Awakens is an exciting new chapter to the SW saga. But there are problems, which it would be easy to get overly critical about. First off, what they got right about this film. New characters: on the surface they're different and compelling enough to enjoy. But at times they lack depth (and maybe even maturity). Perhaps that was by design to appeal more to kids. Next (what I like to call) environmental moments! An example of that is in #1 when Anakin is pod racing, a group of sand people are watching & take a shot at one of the pod racers, causing him to crash. Or in #4 when on Tatooine, they enter Mos Eisley in Luke's land speeder, a Jawa can be seen struggling to control a Rhonto beast. It seems like unimportant details, but it goes a long way to making SW seem real (and not just some visually impressive trip thru a fantasy universe)! While not achieving a George Lucas level, JJ Abrams did a respectable job at this, and frankly I don't know if other directors would've even grasped that. As always, the special effects & sound effects are top notch. The action and pace of the movie are done well too. If anything it could've slowed down in a few spots to help add a little more depth to some of the characters. The visual look of the film is commendable. Traditional SW but tweaked just enough to convey a newness to it (examples: storm trooper outfits, TIE fighters, etc)... And now for what's wrong with this movie!! Large holes in character background. While this seems to be a big source of complaint from fans, especially because it lends to unexplained inconsistencies in some of the major characters. Everyone should try and chill out!! Some of this will be covered in the next movie (probably). Some of it will be revealed in the commercial empire of the SW after market (in such things as toys, games, collectors cards, and possibly TV shows & cartoons). We will have to wait and see if it covers all the significant inconsistencies... Having said that, the sheer volume of it is annoying!! More than any other SW movie. Next issue: disappointing performances by the old cast. Han is Han! One of the strongpoints of the film. Leia, at times seems like she's coming down off a hangover, but at other times gives a convincing performance. Even Chewbacca gives a deadpan performance at one important point in the movie.The villain, Kylo Ren, while not being a big disappointment, is a mixed bag. The biggest flaw by far is the plot. The plot is heavily, heavily, heavily recycled!! So much so that it can't be overstated! (Hence the title of this review)! Hopefully the next SW will fix some of the character background issues. But unless they correct the totally unoriginal plot... then, just like in this movie... great visual effects, a great pace, and somewhat compelling characters will not be enough to make up for it.
ID_100385	8	This movie was amazing it is the perfect follow up to the original trilogy. the writing and acting was perfect along with the special effects. it is great to see old characters return as well as meet brand new characters. this movie is a must for true Star Wars fans.
ID_100386	10	"I will not spoil anything, don't worry! I've been a fan since 1977,when I saw the original Star Wars with my dad at a cinema theater (exactly where I actually 20 years later would eat lunch with David Prowse...but that's another story!). It changed me from a 7-year old kid to a 7-year old film fan! And, for sentimental and nostalgic reason, nothing can be compared to the original trilogy (1977-1983) if you ask me! Still, I ""kind of"" like the prequel trilogy (1999-2005), even if it can't be compared to the original ones. Maybe a generation thing but they lacked ""fascination"".BUT the new sequel trilogy is on a whole different level! It IS really good! Damn good!!! Why? Because the script has ""feeling"", it introduces new characters that I care for - and that is the most important thing! It's a great script - told with speed like a roller-coaster but JJ Abrams is never forgetting the drama! It's not easy (duuh!) to fulfill all our fan dreams, it's impossible, but hell this is making me long already for the next Episode 8! You understand when you've seen it! Harrison Ford is my favorite actor of all time, actually since 1977 when I first saw Han Solo in action chasing those stormtroopers...so of course it's great to see him return to that galaxy far away a long ago! THAT alone got me SO excited! Hell, the whole planet loves Harrison Ford as Han Solo! He is still going strong, making me wish and hope for INDY 5! Harrison Ford delivers a surprisingly new depth to the saga, he is just great and give the aging Han Solo more ""weight"" (no, he is still in good shape dammit, but you know what I mean!)...but as we all (should) understand this new sequel trilogy is not about the old characters, they are just the link to the new ones. I understand that. Everyone watching it, with certain nostalgic expectations, MUST understand that! Because, seriously,the new star of the Star Wars Saga is the (lovely!) Rey!!! She is just awesome!!! Really really AWESOME!!! I can't believe it, she is the best, most well written female action hero ever!!! Yes! I kid you not. She is interesting and kicking ass! The beautiful and charismatic Daisy Ridley is a new favorite, a new star is born for sure! Hmm. It's night here in Sweden. And I realize now, as I write this about 14 hours after I've seen it here in Sweden, that it's just too much to talk about. So...if anyone is skeptical, just go and see it! I will actually see it again tomorrow - take that as a hint! ;)It's 10/10 for sure! The best film of the year for sure! A worthy sequel for sure! AND best of all, it makes me really honestly ""feel something"" again for this beloved saga, for the first time since 1983!So, yes, the force is wide awake again!!! Gotta love it! :)"
ID_100387		"I was so excited to see this, perhaps too excited. I had watched all of the theory videos and trailer analysis videos and thought I had things figured out. So when I saw it the first time, I went in with preconceived notions and a critical eye, so I ended up disappointed.After reading some other comments saying it was much better the second time, I decided to try again. This time I went in open-minded and tried to view it as pure entertainment, not 'real life.' It was MUCH better that second time. I really enjoyed it. So yeah, OK, I missed on a few of my predictions but so what.So the two main parts that bugged me even after the second time: there were a lot of themes/scenarios that seem repeated from the original trilogy; and there were a handful of deus ex machina type events that gave me some WTF moments.It does end in a cliffhanger, but as the first movie in a trilogy, I can handle that.See it in 3d in a theater with reclining seats."
ID_100388	9	"The first line in this movie is ""This will begin to make things right."" I feel like that's a jab at the prequels. ""Hey, we know the prequels were awful, but this new movie will begin to make things right."" Probably not intentional, but clever nonetheless. My goodness, this movie is so well done! The parallels and metaphors are so cleverly written. Even if you haven't seen any Star Wars movies before, you can watch this as a standalone. Will you get more out of it if you've seen the original trilogy? Of course. Is it essential viewing before going into this one? No. The plot does at times feel ""Been there, seen that,"" because it is essentially a remake of A New Hope. However, there's enough new bits in the story that left me satisfied. The practical effects are so well done, and the very little CGI in the movie looks more realistic than the prequels ever did. There's an important message in the movie, and the characters are relatable. Unlike some of the characters in the prequels, you care about what happens to these new characters. They're acting is great, and the classic actors still feel like their characters. Harrison Ford is still great with the zingers, and C-3PO is still the worrisome robot we all love. J. J. Abrams has restored what we all love about Star Wars. Even before the classic characters show up, it still feels like a Star Wars movie. If the upcoming films are even 1/4 as good as this was, there's a new hope for the Star Wars franchise.
Grade: A- 9/10 4/5 stars"
ID_100389	6	When Return of the Jedi ended its cinema run back in 1983, Star Wars fans were forced to endure a terrible 16-year wait for George Lucas to final greenlight the next instalment, The Phantom Menace (1999). Fan delirium soon turned to head shaking and bewilderment when the result turned out to be a soulless CGI-fest with bad acting and the most annoying character ever to grace the silver screen (narrowly beating Kate Capshaw from Indian Jones and the Temple of Doom). The prequel trilogy mercifully ended in 2006, bringing to a close one of the most disappointing movie events in history.When Disney bought the rights to Lucasfilm in 2012 during a spending spree that would see them also gobble up Marvel and Pixar, they wasted no time at all developing a brand new trilogy and various spin-offs. The wait for the final product was far shorter than the build-up to The Phantom Menace, and I have no doubt that fans will be far more impressed with the result than back in '99. J.J. Abrams' The Force Awakens, subtitled Episode VII, re-captures the spirit of Lucas's original trilogy while correcting the many flaws of the prequels. It has about as much depth as Attack of the Clones - the poorest of the series in my opinion - but makes sure it brings its ensemble of new characters to life while welcoming back a handful of familiar faces.30 years have passed since Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) watched his father die while Han Solo (Harrison Ford), Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) and an army of Ewoks sent the Empire fleeing for their lives. During this time, Luke has fled into hiding following a disastrous attempt to train a new batch of Jedi warriors, and a new enemy named the First Order have emerged in his absence. Resistance pilot Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) is sent to the planet Jakku to retrieve a map revealing Luke's location from hooded elder Lor San Tekka (Max von Sydow). However, the First Order - led by the brutal Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) - arrive and capture Poe, destroying Tekka's village in the process.One of Ren's stormtroopers, FN-2187 (John Boyega) - who is later given the name of Finn - has a change of heart following his first experience of battle with the First Order, and helps Poe escape in a TIE fighter. Arriving back at Jakku to retrieve the map from Poe's droid BB-8, Finn comes across scrap metal scavenger Rey (Daisy Ridley) who is taking temporary care of the vulnerable robot, and the two flee together when they are attacked. Stealing a ship that just happens to be the Millennium Falcon, they are soon re-captured by a charismatic smuggler called Han Solo and his furry friend Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew), who understandably want their ship back. Soon enough, Rey and Finn find themselves caught up in an intergalactic war between good and evil.If that all sounds kind-of familiar, then it's probably because you've seen A New Hope (1977) before. It's a thinly-disguised recycling of the same plot, which it turns out works both for and against the film. In many ways, it feels like the natural continuation of the original story that most of us love, suggesting that history does repeat itself and few learn from the errors of the past. It could also be argued as lazy storytelling, copying a proved formula and avoiding the risks that come with taking a familiar world into new territory. While I think both points are valid, I feel it actually works on easing us back into a franchise that many feel was reduced to a laughing stock following the calamity of the prequel trilogy, and this really does feel like Star Wars again, with sets that can actually be touched and CGI aliens that feel full of life.Rey and Finn prove to be multi-dimensional new protagonists while their back-stories are spoken of rather than explored. Abrams exploits their quirks to comedic effect - Boyega in particular is very funny - and both are suitably flawed and poor enough to feel like actual heroes when they finally grab a lightsaber. Ren is also interesting - masked for the bulk of the movie, it's a surprise when he is revealed to be a wet-lipped and long-faced Adam Driver (even though I knew he was under there), prone to immature temper tantrums and facing his own inward dilemma. The movie's main issue is its lack of depth. While the First Order are painted more broadly as Third Reich-esque than before - especially in one ridiculous rally scene in which the pasty-faced General Hux (Domhnall Gleeson) shouts to a meticulously arranged army like a Leni Reifenstahl documentary - we never really understand their motives.And so we are left with a basic good vs. evil story with a startling lack of grey, which may have been refreshingly old-fashioned had the experience not been so similar to A New Hope. Similar to what he did with re-booting the Star Trek franchise, Abrams keeps things light and simple for the most part, treading carefully to avoid overdoing the homages. Chocked full of contrivances that seem like the writers have forgotten that the action is taking place across an entire galaxy, you have to forgive a lot of the films flaws to truly enjoy it, and although this was far from a perfect experience, I was happy to be back in a world that I thought (and hoped) I'd seen the last of. And when the toe-tingling final scene cuts to black, I was quick to check what year the next one is due.
ID_100390	6	This post doesn't contain spoilers.I always valued a good story and character development more than all the rest. The previous movies were not perfect, but I become fond of them in a way. Today I witnessed how money is once again the only thing that matters.Before I even saw the movie I predicted 70% of the story, which is a truly disturbing fact. Cheap jokes and all the unnecessary dialogs were turning the movie second by second into uninteresting and boring adaptation of the previous series. Harrison Jones is a great actor, but his time in Star Wars is over. Time to move on, focus on new heroes, tell us how they feel deep inside, picture their emotions and actions from a different side of view, not just Disney fairy tale, we had enough of this already.I tried to like it, I truly did, but it is too shallow, too simple... As a mediocre star wars fan, going on a midnight premiere in a helm of Kylo Ren, I am disappointed.
