ID_100001	7	This film really is nothing more than an Advertisement. I'll admit the first time I saw it at the movies I thought it was pretty good, and i watched it another two times with friends and family over the course of a month before it finally left theatres. But after seeing it again, I realised something is off, something is not right about this movie. It's completely hollow with nothing beyond its visualsThe movie is well shot, I'll say that. It has great looking effects, but it's only there to hide the fact that once you look past all the superficial razzle dazzle to hide the mess underneath. The movie is nothing more than a shadow of the previous movies. Everything about it feels rushed. The characters are so aloof and seem almost brain dead. The dialogue is so shallow and paper thin, it's like the writers just gave up. The characters hardly develop or learn anything and Rey's transition to a Jedi is so fast and forced, you can see how how obvious that the writers were too lazy to even bother to give give her a proper arc and story and make her feel like an actual human we can care about. Because that would be too long and boring, wouldn't it... God forbid challenge people's short attention spans... Who even needs real developed characters... Nobody cares about that anymore... Just give them the razzle dazzle crap or whatever???It really is sad just how empty this movie is. The third time I watched it, it actually physically left a bad taste in my mouth, thank god for popcorn...
ID_100002	8	Star Wars: The Force Awakens Is a newest chapter in the long running Space opera saga, taking place 30 years after the events of Return of the Jedi. We learn from the opening text crawl that in the absence of Luke Skywalker, the sinister First Order has risen into power led by the menacing Kylo Ren(Adam Driver), who is on the hunt for the last Jedi Knight Luke Skywalker. He is introduced into the film in an explosive sequence setting the tone for the remainder of the film. Driver brings a lot of raw emotion to the part of Ren, who's being tormented by his feelings, and lure to the Light and Dark side. During the opening scene Ren comes into contact with newcomer Poe Dameron(Oscar Issac) a rebel fighter pilot regarded as the best in the resistance. Who is handed a vital piece of information, that could lead to the whereabouts of Luke Skywalker, and thus sets off a chain of events bringing in old and new characters alike. Issac brings a-lot of likability as Poe to the film, and was reminiscent of Han Solo(Harrison Ford) In the original trilogy. Whilst on the Planet of Jakku we're introduced to Finn(John Boyega) a disillusioned stormtrooper, who wants out of the First Order. Boyega plays the part with a lot enthusiasm, and joy he brings a lot of laughs to the story whilst maintaining his own dramatic moments through out the story. He eventually comes into contact with a scavenger named Rey(Daisy Ridley) on the planet Jakku. Who struggles to make a living finding scraps/relics for food, she is also torn between waiting for her family to come back, and realising that her journey is much more then salvaging parts, when She crosses paths with Finn and a lovable new droid named BB8. After a thrilling escape from the First Order our heroes come across veterans of the original series Han Solo(Ford) and the Wookie Chewbacca(Peter Mayhew). Ford does a good job of tying the mythos of the original trilogy, and connecting us with the newcomers, without ever leaving old viewers feeling cold and new viewers guessing as too what is happening.From the moment the film begins it maintains a breakneck pace, that hardly allows the viewer to stop and reflect what's happening with the plot of the film, which Is a good thing, because there are a-lot of plot holes In the film. We are also given enough information sprinkled throughout the film so that all the new characters feel fleshed out enough, to make us care about them.The film spends most of the first half on a desert planet named Jakku, The cinematography Is beautiful to look at, the screen Is filled with sweeping landscapes that gives the world a vast feeling of isolation and hopelessness. Disney brought In director JJ Abrams, who recently came off of rebooting the successful Star Trek franchise. He's the perfect choice to re-invigorate this franchise, his use of practical effects give this film a weight that all the prequels were sorely missing. We feel the size and scope of Starkiller Base, the heaviness of the Lightsabers, you feel the impact of the blaster rifles. The use of real locations and sets also give the film a-lot of natural colour which bursts onto the screen. Where-as the prequel trilogy which was all shot on digital, and Used a lot of CGI characters and effects. CGI in the film is used to a minimum and only used when needed. There were however a couple of characters, Unkar Plutt and Maz Kanata which felt like they could of been done better. In a couple scenes they look out place when surrounded by practical effects and actors in costumes and make up. Overall the film is visually stunning to look at because of this it gives the film(and series) a fresh vibrancy that has been lacking since Return of the Jedi. There are also just the right amount of callbacks, without it becoming crowd-pleasing, there is a plenty of nostalgia and references to the original films that fans of the series will recognise. John Williams also creates a new score with him that feels a little lacklustre when compared to original and prequel films. The only memorable theme being Kylo Rens.There were on the other hand certain aspects of the film which felt like it was treading old water from A New Hope, especially Starkiller Base, which is essentially a third Deathstar that feels like it's only part of the film so there's a third act, for all our heroes too band together and fight. It's hard not too notice certain similarities from the A New Hope, and at times feels like It's been done to play things safe after the backlash of the Prequels. The film is also filled a lot of humorous moments as-well, which helps to lighten up some of the darker aspects of the film, although not every joke hits the mark, and occasionally they feel out of place, especially during the the last act of the film.Star Wars the: The Force Awakens is filled with excellent set pieces which immerses the audience back into the universe. We're given enough plot information, and character development to draw us into the the new generation of characters. Whilst some areas feel familiar, there Is a lot too love about this film, watching this In the Cinema was an Incredibly exciting and engaging experience, which had me feeling like a kid watching the original films for the first time and being swept away into a galaxy far, far away. This film has resurrected the Star Wars franchise, and made it one of the must see film experiences of the year.
ID_100003	8	When I go to the movies, I aim to experience one thing: escapism. Even if it's for only two hours, I like to occasionally escape this often unfair world we all live in and lose myself in a fictional adventure. And I think I speak for both the young and the young at heart when I say that Star Wars has brought escapism to audiences all over the globe and for many generations over the past 40 years.I was born in the mid 1990s, so I never had a chance to experience the original Star Wars trilogy on the big screen and this was something that I had a hard time accepting ever since I was a child. I never thought I would be able to see Luke Skywalker, Han Solo or Princess Leia on the big screen ever in my life time. So you can imagine my excitement when I found out that they were making another Star Wars film that was not only inventing an entirely new cast of fresh faced characters, but was also bringing back the cast from the original films, who that of which have not walked on a Star Wars set for over 30 years. So it brings me great delight to be able to tell you that the most recent installment in the franchise did not disappoint.The new characters of the film are all fully developed and come with their own strengths and insecurities. They don't clash with the old cast, but instead melt beautifully with them in every scene. Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, Oscar Isaac and Adam Driver all do amazingly well. The old cast of course are all stellar too. They slipped back into their respected characters so seamlessly, it feels as though no time has passed at all.I was already familiar with J.J Abrams directing style going into this film. He, once again...does not fail to impress. This film is rife with stunning cinematography. The various locations are as gorgeous as they are aesthetically pleasing. CGI is used in this film, but to my relief it does not overpower the organic and practical effects. The environment in which these characters are staged in feels so authentic and believable, you feel as though you are a part of the journey yourself. It's instantly apparent that this film was made by a man who loves Star Wars just as much as we do.Overall, the film is a triumph. It's a wonderful collaboration of new and old filming techniques that combine beautifully to create the ultimate Star Wars film that everyone can enjoy. It doesn't matter if this is your first experience with the Star Wars saga, or if you've watched all of the films one hundred times over, fans both new and familiar will equally appreciate the love and care that was tirelessly thrown into this dazzling, epic adventure. I anxiously await the next installment.
ID_100004	8	If there's any movie you should see in theaters, The Force Awakens is it. From the first frame you're sucked right back into the Star Wars universe, and that's probably the best part of the movie - it feels genuinely like Star Wars. Not a child-pandering political farce (The Phantom Menace), a melodramatic soap opera (I'm looking at you Attack of the Clones) or a CGI filled sensory overload (Revenge of the Sith anyone?). No, it's barebones Star Wars. Visually stunning, constantly engaging, and most of all, it's incredibly fun. There are a lot of parallels with A New Hope, like how we're beginning this epic adventure with vastly different characters and learning their stories for the first time. And it shares the basic outline of that movie as well from the monumental opening shot to its massive riveting climax. It's a blast from beginning to end, and especially exhilarating in a packed IMAX theater. The characters are easily relatable from the moment they're shown. Their stories are simple and to the point, allowing the audience to follow them in their journey every step of the way. There's also a lot of humor in the movie, and not the dopey kind either. It's clever and self-referential humor that suits the characters and their motivations while also being damn funny in context.It's hard to put this into words because if you're a fan, you're well aware that watching Star Wars is an experience. There's a rush of being back in the universe and seeing some of your favorite characters again. The threats are even bigger this time around. The First Order is what the Empire has become, led by Supreme Leader Snoke and his apprentice Kylo Ren. At first glance Kylo might seem like a second-rate Vader, but he has much more depth than that. Things are revealed in the movie that piece everything together, and when all is said and done, Kylo Ren is not only a great villain but a great character - charismatic but insecure, arrogant but unexperienced. You can empathize with him at times, but it's obvious there's great darkness within him, and not only because of his haunting mask. The heroes Rey and Finn are immediately likable and easy to root for, and when they start uncovering the bigger picture behind the First Order's sinister plot, they behave exactly as you'd expect them to. Not pompous or valiant but hesitant and curious, at least until their lives are on the line and the only way for them to survive is to band together. Then their inner heroism comes to light.Everything about The Force Awakens is phenomenal - the acting, directing, and writing are all on point, and it serves as a wonderful template for this new Star Wars era. I don't need to spoil anything because the fact is, if you loved the original trilogy you're going to love this. Hell, if you're a fan of good cinema you should love this. Episode VII is what Star Wars fans have been yearning for, and when all is said and done, I couldn't ask for anything more.
ID_100005	9	"It's as if millions of Star Wars fans suddenly cried out in criticism and were suddenly silenced. That's the effect this movie *should* have on most (other than those who'd already decided they were going to be disappointed/hate it no matter what). For all the SANE Star Wars fans out there, I'm happy to report that the Force is strong with this series once again (after taking a walk on the Dark Side with the prequels). All other shoddy imitations take note: THIS is how you do a space opera. The Force Awakens possesses everything that was missing from the soulless prequels: we have a non-snooze-worthy storyline, likable new characters, great acting, non-cringe-worthy dialogue and not such a reliance on only CGI effects/green-screen. The pluses of this movie are in abundance, starting with what's new. All those with reservations about the fresh young actors cast to play new characters Rey and Finn should sit back, relax and watch the beautiful chemistry between the two as their characters form a believable friendship/dynamic on screen like that of the Original Trilogy's trio.Daisy Ridley more than proves she's up to the challenge of having a large portion of the new trilogy rest on her shoulders. Rey is a scavenger with a good heart (as evidenced by her rescuing BB-8, a droid carrying something important). Whilst certain people (who for some unfathomable reason don't like seeing a woman who can handle herself) may take this new female lead (who is smart, brave, kind and just all around awesome) as a personal affront to them, for the rest of us who *don't* hate seeing a woman take centre stage, this is what we've been looking for in a female character for so long. She's everything you could hope for, but not without her faults, as she does make some mistakes (but not enough to hate her for it). She's flawed, but much more interesting because of this. Ridley imbues her character with so much heart/soul, she conveys a lot with just looks and even proves adept at humour as well. Most importantly, she's *likable*, forming instant friendships with other characters who we already like (so we know she's awesome). Any gripes about her would be nitpicky/for petty reasons.Sharing Ridley's responsibility as one of the new faces of this trilogy is John Boyega as Finn, a former Stormtrooper who refuses to go along with the rest in doing something terrible. It's after this that he meets Oscar Isaac's Poe Dameron, who he forms an almost-immediate friendship with. Out of the three new leads, Isaac's Poe is probably given the least development, but he manages to make it believable that he and Finn become close friends in such a short time. The best dynamic, though, is without a doubt the one formed between Rey and Finn. The way they play off each other with such ease is, in large part, thanks to the actors, but also the dialogue being snappy/quick-witted. They share a fun friendship, becoming quite close, and the actors' enthusiasm/energy helps a lot, as they're truly inhabiting their roles/believing in who they're playing as well as the universe they're a part of (where characters talk/act in a unique way). One of many things the prequels sadly lacked was heart, but this movie/these characters have it in spades.Adam Driver's Kylo Ren picks up where Darth Vader left off as our main villain and is clearly devoted to his memory (since he talks to his burned mask). Driver is quite good at playing the bad guy, though he is prone to the occasional 'hissy fit' with his crossguard lightsaber which verges into slightly over-the-top/petulant teenager behavior. Thankfully, when the big moments occur, Driver shows real emotion/conflict within his character. His lightsaber duel, first with Finn and then Rey, is everything the over-choreographed prequel duels were lacking. They may've had the needless fancy twirling and whatnot, but here we have rough and tumble, gritty fights between someone skilled and two people who are only just learning what they're capable of. Plus there's real emotional investment, which helps. It's an epic tension-filled battle, which is a BIG plus with this movie, as we don't know what's going to happen.Naturally, it's good to see our old favourites back (Han, Chewie, Leia, R2-D2, C-3PO, even the Millennium Falcon, all of which received applause at my screening). Those claiming this film relies on nostalgia/good will towards the original films alone are mistaken. Whilst the prequels included familiar characters/moments just for the sake of callbacks, what they do here is much more satisfying. Han is his usual charming, funny, ""scruffy-looking nerf-herder"" self, but he forms attachments to our new characters, and his dynamics with them allows for some of the film's best moments. The movie certainly has humour, but thankfully it's not the ""cutsie"" nauseating variety found in the prequels. There are genuinely funny moments for young and old alike.J.J. Abrams has been unfairly criticised, when he should be receiving thanks. He had the unenviable task of reinvigorating/re-energising the franchise after the prequels nearly killed it and has managed to do so successfully. So what if there's some familiarity? My only quibbles were Domhnall Gleeson's shouty performance and Andy Serkis' CGI Supreme Leader Snoke. In most other instances, Abrams ensured that, along with story/character development, locations/miniatures/practical effects/make-up took precedence over a reliance on CGI/things that simply 'looked cool'. Some familiar musical themes appear on the score, but there are also some new ones which I appreciated were more restrained and not so 'in-your-face' as certain popular themes introduced in the prequels. There is also an abundance of excellent shots throughout the movie; quite a few are instantly iconic. It would be quite the feat for the following films to match this thrilling/exciting and enjoyable/satisfying first chapter of a new era in the saga. If nothing else, at least The Force Awakens easily beats The Phantom Menace in being a great start to a new trilogy of films."
ID_100006	6	"From the virtue signaling of social justice, to the cheap-jack plot-line which was easily discerned in advance, to the awful acting which evoked little but hooting from me, I was, as you can see, disappointed, and in some cases outraged. If you dare to join me, I will explain.I have nothing against diversifying the Star Wars universe, which is why I LOVED Star Wars 1, with its Oriental villains, Jamaican Gungan, Jewish scrap dealer, and more. It was a delight of indulgence which fleshed out characters of charm, making the experience vivid and interesting. But after Lucas received flak for ethnic portrayal, Jar-Jar became boring in Star Wars 2. In Star Wars 7, this pandering becomes intolerable. It's fine that Leah has the force, and it's fine that Rey inherited it, but Finn is gratuitous in his race. I would have nothing against this either but they make Finn formidable with a light-sabre against Kylo Ren. And please don't soft-soap me that love gave Finn the strength and skill to take on a pupil of the force - only hate has that power, the dark side. Otherwise, one must be cool and focused. Given this, I dismiss Finn and therefore it irritated me to watch Kylo Ren sword-play with Finn and not simply crush his windpipe with a wave of his hand, or penetrate his mind, which seems to be Ren's forte. As for Kylo vs. Rey, a bit more believable, but it made Kylo seem almost inept. Really? Rey's raw ability with zero training is tougher than Kylo with training? Not even close to believable.What didn't I like about the plot? Well, first, aren't we simply replaying Death Star destruction from the first trilogy? Why, yes we are. And it looks like the Supreme Leader made all the same engineering, logistic, and tactical errors as the Emperor, just on a grander scale, including the convenient ""having to recharge the cannon"" just long enough for the Resistance to ""win the day."" Yawn. Second, much of the plot was geared to exploit the Skywalker/Solo family tree, and there was no thrill to any of it. Darth Vader is Luke's father - WHOA! I jumped out of my seat. Han is Kylo's father? Zzzz. Even if you wanted to say this was a remake, which it's not, it doesn't have the pizazz, never mind the oomph, of the original. But what does? But the acting is where I think I really blew my cool. I can understand characters of convenience, and plot-lines of olde being rehashed, but it has to be acted well to pull it off. Even in Star Wars 3, as sappy as it was, the acting was GREAT, IMO. In Star Wars 7, Harrison Ford is just about limping to his finale, Carrie Fisher looks doddering and not commanding, Daisy Ridley grits her teeth so often I thought she was Red Sonja, John Boyega makes a concerted effort to appear naive at every turn (which makes his good fortune all the more unbearable), Adam Driver does not look torn in the least, and so forth.I can point to hundreds of interesting and thrilling moments from the first six episodes of Star Wars which makes a complete weekend binge-watch, over and over again. Star Wars 7 does not add to that excitement. The tech seems standard, the CGI a little too self-conscious, the nostalgic cheese forced, the push forward too bossy and not natural. Still, I give this film a 6 in the hopes that Star Wars 8 will push the envelope once again."
ID_100007	9	Loved the original 'Star Wars' films as a kid, still do. Especially 'Empire Strikes Back' while considering 'A New Hope' a genre landmark. Didn't think the prequel films were that bad personally, but they had a lot wrong with them and were a long way from great, especially 'Attack of the Clones'.Despite seeing 'Star Wars: Episode VII- The Force Awakens' around the time it first came out (maybe a little after), there was a long time of being put off by the vitriolic hate it's gotten here and the practical war zone there is in order to review it (even when it was critically acclaimed). Finally mustering the courage, count me in as somebody who loved 'Star Wars: Episode VII- The Force Awakens'. A masterpiece? No. Better than the prequels? Absolutely, and although some may disagree this is saying a lot. The best 'Star Wars' film since 'The Return of the Jedi?' Yes.'Star Wars: Episode VII- The Force Awakens' is not the most original plot-wise. It has been criticised for being a re-hash of 'A New Hope', understandably. However, instead of being done in a cheap and slap-in-the-face way, it felt like an affectionate and nostalgic homage. Exemplified by bringing back major characters from the original trilogy in supporting roles. JJ Abrams, and this may be considered blasphemy, does a much better job here than he did with his 'Star Trek' reboot films, here he keeps the original spirit of the original trilogy intact while giving the film its own identity at the same time.While it certainly dazzles in spectacle and action, 'Star Wars: Episode VII- The Force Awakens' doesn't feel too big, too noisy or too chaotic at the expense of creating memorable characters, a fun story and brains and heart. The characters are memorable with easily identifiable leads, the original trilogy characters bringing a lot of affectionate nostalgia and a well executed if not iconic (not by Darth Vader standards anyhow) villain in Kylo Ren (unpredictable and dangerous but feeling he is morally justified).The story lacks originality but more than makes up for it in energy, non-stop heart-thumping thrills and excitement, generosity, a cheerfulness that is positively space operatic, vibrant charm and a few fresh twists along the way. In many ways it is a celebration of the universe while also an expansion of it. It is sometimes sentimental but never overly so, one crucial death scene is just heart-wrenching (particularly Chewbacca's reaction) and doesn't feel like a slap in the face to the character in question.Could the villains have been better written? Ren is fine but Snoke only just about works as a character thanks to the visual effects and especially the powerfully enigmatic with a touch of vulnerability performance of Andy Serkis, other than that the character is underwritten. Also felt that Gwendoline Christie's character was unnecessary, so limited was her screen time.Visually, 'Star Wars: Episode VII- The Force Awakens' is a triumph. It is gorgeously shot and designed with Abrams' visual storytelling shining far more here than it has in other films he's done. The special effects are a dazzling marvel. John Williams delivers yet another rousing score that has its own character but cleverly includes the well-known iconic themes from the previous films. Thank goodness that the dialogue contains little to none of the cheesiness heard in the prequels, and it even has more layers than that of the original trilogy.Acting also shines, with winning charismatic performances from John Boyega and particularly Daisy Ridley. Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher still have it, while Max Von Sydow shows himself to be a master of gestures and eye contact speaking louder than words. Adam Driver is a suitably menacing Ren and Serkis makes much of his somewhat underwritten character. Oscar Isaac gives a typically strong performance.In conclusion, a great film, the best 'Star Wars' film since 'The Return of the Jedi' and one of the best of the saga too. 9/10 Bethany Cox
ID_100008	9	"Star Wars: The Force Awakens steps into a big boots and fills them honorably. The Force Awakens look, feels and sounds like the real Star Wars movie. It contains all the elements that made the original story so epic. It tells an epic story with great scenery and with fine action and adventure. The Force Awakens is like a reboot of an original story, but the same time it is clearly continuation to an original saga. The story and characters are written well. Actors and actresses get through greatly at their roles. No one feels lame or factitious. The story is clearly a tribute to Han Solo, but at the same time it brings new characters well present. Maybe only one thing is not perfect. The story serves background stories of some characters almost too easily and dish out them with no big surprise which made the original movie so epic. The original story was actually a soap opera of one family. There are some elements in this story too, but they are reveled almost too easily. Greatly the story leaves enough of loose ends, so probably we will get bigger surprises of the characters later at upcoming movies.Star Wars: The Force Awakens is loyal to its fans and it lacks of prequels plastic look. It looks familiar, but at a same time it is fresh and interesting. Iconic characters are brought back honorably, but at a same time it tells a new story with new characters. It offer a nostalgic and new epic adventure at same package. Great script offers enough of action and adventure. It almost feels like George Lucas says: ""This is what the Star Wars meant to be"".J.J. Abrams manages to refresh Star Wars saga to present day without forgetting the original fans. It almost feels like I was again that 12 year old boy at 1977, who watched the original story 13 times in two weeks.I watched this movie first time in 2D, but I will watch it again and next time I will see it at 3D, so I will add later to this review how 3D worked in this movie."
ID_100009	5	"In essence a remake of 'A New Hope' as opposed to a proper sequel, the check-box resemblance this long-awaited revival shares to its franchise's debut is genuinely uncanny and sadly staggering since this was the perfect opportunity to try something new considering that the 'Star Wars' moniker is a powerful enough box-office draw to recoup any budget, apparently no matter how exorbitant, and withstand more than a few bad apples (*cough* the prequels *cough*). What's here in 'Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens (2015)' is based on nothing more than nostalgia, a series of slightly sickening ""remember this thing""'s and ""this guy still looks the same but he's grey now""'s that become incredibly tiresome increasingly quickly. If you take away the franchise underlayer you're just left with a hollow, characterless piece that gives you no reason to care and very little actual information despite all its endless exposition. In the end, I was honestly bored even during all of its high-flying fanfare. 5/10"
ID_100010	10	"How do you please franchise fans old and new while making a good, impactful and memorable movie? Do exactly what JJ Abrams did here, to a tee. My friends, real fans who grew up with the original trilogy and watched this one with me, expressed a physically relief of feeling there was very little to complain about and that ""'they' didn't mess it up"", but my feeling was even more positive. They exceeded my high expectations, brought me into a mysterious and magical voyage and left me wanting more until the last frame. A real cinematic experience.Star Wars formula could be deemed to appeal to simplicity (like good vs evil) with a few twists. Fun fact and contingent to the same doctrine, the majority of its meaningful characters name limit themselves to 3 or 4 letters: Han, Luke, Leia, Yoda and now Rey, Poe and Finn. If not letters, we can substitute numbers: R2D2, C3PO or BB8.Well, we can now focus on 2 letters: JJ. JJ Abrams directs and co-writes this brilliant installment in the multi-billion dollar franchise which set ridiculous revenues after a record-breaking first day (not counting merchandise and video sales)It also comes with extremely favourable critics and has started an epic new trilogy as well as spin-offs we all hope will continue to remain a high level of quality such as Rogue One already did incredibly. But back to this highly anticipated sequel which manages to create nostalgic moments with its characters, settings and story. Every Star Wars Fans will enjoy the scenery of a defunct Star Destroyer in the desert, but overall cinematography and scenery is in fact the best of all the Star Wars by its beauty and diversity. We get sultry desert in Jakku like Tatooine and forest like Endor. We get beautiful snow that surpass Hoth, buildings and water like Naboo and idyllic Irish-like islands. Daniel Mindel is the cinematographer who also did marvels with JJ on the first 2 Star Trek reboots. Every battle scene is sweeping and spectacular with many elements, motion and emotion. Humour is effective and tension is well crafted and augmented by sound, music and editing.Here Abrams outdoes himself by keeping it crisp with new likable and believable characters, great acting and superb directing to keep everything flowing and fans following. We feel for the characters, old and new. We are intrigued and we do not want it to end. A pretty much perfect movie of the genre and for a new generation, with Rey a particular stand-out.Han and Leia were not only there for older fans, but make it work as very important elements to the story. The writing and directing for them is just right, like the rest of the movie. Award-worthy, action-packed, well-paced, high expectations delivered and then some.It's decisively the best Star Wars yet, and that is no small feat. One small step for a fan, but a giant leap for longevity and quality!Rian Johnson has some SERIOUS shoes to fill for Episode 8.10/10"
ID_100011	9	The opening of Star Wars, The Force Awakens, with the titles traveling along the screen, and the orchestra following in the background, immediately absorbed me into the experience. Although I initially feared this sequel would fall flat, from the very beginning, the film sends its audience on a magnificent ride across the galaxy. There are significant gaps in the story-line, from the conclusion of the last installment up until this point in time, some of which are addressed over the film's duration, while others will hopefully be answered in future episodes. Despite some segments of the film bearing a striking resemblance to scenes encountered in previous installments, these are so well delivered, they offer the viewer moments of nostalgia, that have not been felt, since the original trilogy, all those years ago.Acting heavy-weights, like Harrison Ford in his return as Han Solo, Carrie Fisher as General Leia Organa and Mark Hamill as Luke Skywalker, help revitalize the franchise, though their screen time is minimal in contrast with the new faces. Ford offers both a melancholic and nostalgic performance, that lends emotion to his scenes, as a former war hero turned smuggler, while his take charge attitude, and banter with Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew), remains as entertaining as ever. Max Von Sydow additionally has a cameo role, of significant import, though again, deserved more time on screen.Rey (Daisey Ridley) is a scavenger on the desert planet of Jakku, who scroungers desperately to survive, while awaiting the return of her lost family. When she encounters a droid, BB-8, she has no idea of the adventure, not to mention the danger, she has inadvertently put herself in. Holding information vital to both the Resistance, the protagonists in the film, and the First Order, the villainous group that has taken over from the Galactic Empire, it seems almost everyone in the galaxy is seeking its retrieval. Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), a Sith with an interestingly poignant past, is one such character who pursues the droid, in the hopes of capturing the information contained within.Driver, most known for his comedic roles, is especially great, being as villainous as he is sentimental, brilliantly demonstrating a man with no control over his emotions. In contrast, fellow villains, including General Hux (Domhnall Gleeson), and Captain Phasma (Gwendoline Christie), don't appear as frequently, nor receive as much depth, which is unfortunate, considering how interesting their characters are.When Rey encounters Finn (John Boyega), a storm trooper, who despises the violent actions of the First Order, they are forced to make a series of difficult choices, that will lead them on a journey across the universe. Boyega and Ridley are equally terrific in their roles, and are great characters for the audience to follow, demonstrating acts of heroism and courage throughout the film.Furthermore, landscapes across the universe depict planets that have continued on after the war with the Galactic Empire, the remnants of fallen behemoths dotting the horizons. The vehicles and weaponry that are utilized, remind audiences of episodes four thought to six, and the moment the light sabre makes its appearance, I doubt a single person will be able to contain their excitement.The soundtrack is very much reminiscent of the franchise, and legitimizes the experience. The special effects are incredible, from battles in outer space, to fights on the ground, lasers and explosions littering the battlefield of the frequent, and fast paced, action scenes. Though Episodes Seven is basically one action scene after the next, the script provides enough emotional depth and characterization between these scenes, to keep audiences invested. Not only this, humor is well incorporated, the banter between characters, alongside the one-liners, bringing a series of laughs, beside the frenetic explosions.To view the film in 3D offers the viewer significant depth, though moments when characters, props, or the general setting, jump out at the audience, are quite minimal. When this does occur, often it is from the left, or the right of the screen, rather than from the very center, making the effect less impressive. If you were hoping to feel as though you might get hit at any moment by an incoming laser, sadly, that will not transpire here.Though a couple of moments during the plot are predictable, Star Wars Episode Seven is a brilliant return to a franchise that was originally only meant to house six episodes. If this new installment is what we ought to expect from the upcoming films, then the Star Wars universe is looking very bright indeed.
ID_100012	10	"I will try to keep this as spoiler free as possible, but if you still haven't seen it: stop reading about it, and go see it.In The Force Awakens, as with other reboots and sequels of old franchises, it's a challenge to balance the old with the new. The two previous trilogies were both of their time, and different in many ways. This new one will also need to be of its time, and different from the other ones. Story wise, it's obviously more connected to the original trilogy. In addition to this, the structure of the movie itself is very much based on the older trilogy. Much of the movie acts like a parallel to episode IV, while at the same time feeling different enough to not be considered a remake or rehash of the same ideas.As in other sequels, the original cast - now old and weary - is back in this one. Without going into spoilers, I will say that they all did a superb job acting wise, and I liked the way their stories has progressed. What's more interesting, though, is that is the new characters you end up feeling most excited about. It's great to see the old cast, and they are very much involved in the plot, with important parts in regards to action and plot. But still, it's the new characters you come out of the cinema thinking about, and look forward to seeing again. Especially Kylo Ren was interesting. I like how they portrayed the conflict between the light and dark side of the force, it's much more believable than it feels in the other movies (especailly the prequel trilogy).The movie is much more busy than the previous films. I think that's natural in today's cinema environment, and that it works well. Watching it, the story just kept on giving, and there was great, fantastic scenes throughout. I wasn't bored for a second. I can see this disappointing some fans - but as mentioned before, I think that Star Wars movies should be of their time. The special effects were fantastic as well. The practical effects, like costumes and so, worked brilliantly in conjunction with the newer stuff. The few CGI/Mo-cap-characters that had big roles were maybe the weakest point SFX-wise, but they were by no means eyesores.The movie ends in a way that to me was satisfying. It's obviously the first part of a longer story, and there's many more questions to be answered. Some less significant questions I assume will not be answered in the big movies, but rather TV-shows or other media. The big questions will obviously come back in the later movies. Especially regarding the back story of certain new characters, and the whole situation in the galaxy. (On that note: I liked the opening crawl. Informative and to the point. Neiter the crawl nor the rest of the movie is too heavily focused on ""what happened in-between"" VI and VII.) A last note: I've seen people complain (and worry) about too much fan service. As a fan, I am mostly very happy with the choices they made.Take this review with a pinch of salt. I was very much a part of the hype leading up to this movie, and I might have other thoughts after a re-watch or two."
ID_100013	6	"Ever since I was a kid, I loved this franchise. Even episode 1, by far the worst in the series, had that ""star-wars feel"". Mostly thanks to great casting of Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor, awesome new dark side character and dual light saber. So despite extremely high expectations, the series wasn't ruined and effectively picked up in dark episode 3. Then Disney followed up with this one, with J.J.Abrams at helm, which once again rose the expectations. Well it's not good. Especially the casting and acting of younger stars. Even Harrison Ford and Chewy can't save this mess. It may be a blasphemy, but unfortunately Ford can't pull off ' ""the cool"". Sorry guys, he's a bit too old, so some action scenes look out of place. The casting of young stars was atrocious. Simply bad. Bad chemistry, Bad looks (ecpecially the Kylo Ren character), badly choreographed fights, Bad everything. On top of which, Abrams took the period as a remake of original which should not be touched! At all. Due to stunning (as expected) visuals, and a personal love to the universe, this movie can be watched, but if this awful trend continues, even special effects and millions of fans won't be able to save the series."
ID_100014	10	A fantastic addition to the Star Wars series!Great story, excellent acting, brilliant action, and so on.The photography was sweeping and excellent. The characters were imaginative and fresh. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and would watch it again without hesitation.The plot was easily the best of the entire series and the cast were all outstanding in their parts.I truly look forward to the next installment and hope J. J. is at the helm. (Scratch that, he actually is!!!!)
ID_100015	9	This movie is the perfect way to introduce Star Wars to a generation that was almost plagued with nothing but those god awful prequels.The characters are likable, the story is similar but with a fresh new take, and it pays homage to the original trilogy by mixing in ideas from the first three movies and combining them into this visual masterpiece. Personally, there is only one problem I have with this movie, the rathar chase. But even that I didn't have too much of a problem with.Overall Star Wars: The Force Awakens is one of the best if not the best movie released in 2015, here's hoping The Last Jedi continues this trend
ID_100016	10	I saw this movie with my wife and I have to say this was even better than I ever thought possible!All these people that want to compare this to episode 4 are just the type of people I am sure that just can't be pleased no matter what you do for them. Wake up spammers with boring lives, This is STAR WARS driven by the best part of the force. I consider this a continuation of brilliance at its finest. You people that endlessly cry about this movie did actually see it, right? LOL Can't wait to see this story continue for years to come. This has made me an even bigger fan of Star Wars. I thought the acting was top notch, especially Harrison Ford, he stepped right back into that role perfectly.Enjoy an amazing movie for exactly what it is.........AMAZING!
ID_100017	10	This film is great! I have seen this movie 5 times and it never got old. In my opinion it got better!! It has a great heroin in rey and villain in Kylo and great action scenes and emotional scenes! Is Star Wars at its best the second best star wars movie out there! Go see it on a big screen with the volume turned all the way up!:)
ID_100018	9	There are very few people who won't admit this is the most anticipated movie of this decade. Taking all those expectations into account reviewing this title is quite a difficult and delicate thing but after seeing this movie on its release day it is impossible to hide all these positive emotions. Every fan will rediscover his inner child and get goosebumps at almost every reference to the galaxy far away.J.J. Abrams is one of the most acclaimed directors of his generation and putting him at the helm of this project was undoubtedly right decision. The way he handles this ultra-heavyweight burden of expectations and historical importance is just jaw-dropping. Throughout 135 minutes of the movie your mind travels through flurry of his impeccably executed ideas. Perhaps the best thing about this movie is that it still feels fresh despite (expectedly,I must admit) putting so many references to the previous installments. Those references are also the reason I didn't give 10 stars. Sometimes you get the feeling that it is all about refreshing all the stuff from 70s and 80s. Most likely that is the result of big corporation (Disney) standing behind high grossing project as Star Wars really are. But don't worry about that too soon because flaws are easily overshadowed by a decent plot and cinematography at its very highest.Cast consists of both rising stars and franchise veterans. And this combination never fails to amaze because the chemistry between characters is just like in the old days of Star Wars when Harrison Ford and co. were not that famous. Boyega and Ridley give their best and really live for this movie and their ambition about this project is almost palpable. Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) may feel like Darth Vader 2.0 but he is somehow more intriguing. Queen Leia and Han Solo are just as good as ever and having them back here is a real joy. Luke,well his story is more of a mystery,that's all I can say.Whatever your attitude towards this one is,if you ever liked any of the six previous parts you should go for this one. Despite sometimes feeling a bit too familiar and serial it is more than welcome arrival in this franchise. Whole crew just put their hearts into this one and created a magnetic atmosphere that really makes this one of the most enjoyable movies of 2010s so far. I wouldn't dare to say it is the best of 2015 but it is definitely up there among the best.
ID_100019	6	Why another less than superlative review? It's the movies I guess - or Hollywood. There is a good one planned shortly to make up - I promise.Long before this film arrived I claimed you couldn't do Star Wars over. This Disney remake has proved me right. It leaves me wondering if walking away from Lucas was a good thing to do. It's true he overreached himself with the prequels and botched the whole thing. But they could have done better with a proper director and screenwriter. Lucas had the vision, there's no doubt about that.Back to this film: I'm scratching my head. On the one hand it feels like a total remake of the first film with a few corny exceptions.After the last scene, I had to wonder if maybe there WAS a story sweep coming out of all this rehashed mess. Something original perhaps. That would be nice.That's the reason I advise Disney to never do this again. If they want to utilize Star Wars in their theme parks, well that's fine. Just don't ruin a classic syfy saga to do it.
ID_100020	6	"A fairly long time ago, in a county not so far away (Elstree Studios are an hour's drive away from yours truly), a great adventure took place. Now, J.J. Abrams, in league with the 'House of Mouse', has returned to make a seventh chapter in the franchise, and it's almost identical in plot to the first film, but with only a fraction of the magic and charm.Daisy Ridley plays Luke sorry, I mean Rey a scavenger on the desert planet of Tatooinesorry, I mean Jakku who becomes involved in the rebellion against The Empire sorry I mean The First Order after she bumps into R2D2 sorry, I mean BB-8, a droid carrying plans to the death star sorry, I mean to the whereabouts of Luke Skywalker. Meanwhile, the First Order are preparing their new weapon, the Death Star sorry, I mean Starkiller Base for use against the rebellion, who are forced to launch a risky counter-attack that sees Rey coming face-to-face with masked villain Darth Vadersorry, I mean Kylo Ren (Adam Driver).I've learnt to keep my expectations low for Star Wars films since The Phantom Menace, so I can't say The Force Awakens was a massive disappointment; it is what I feared it would be—a rather safe reboot, lacking in fresh ideas, which aims to please younger viewers with flashy visuals, whilst pandering to the older generation by including sly nods to the original trilogy. Personally, I would much rather they had taken a bolder approach: let's be honest they couldn't have got it any more wrong than the prequels.There's a spark of originality in the form of Finn (John Boyega), a stormtrooper who has a change of heart and joins the rebellion, the production design and effects are incredible, and I admit that the return of Han Solo and Chewbacca warmed even my cynical heart, but on the whole I was left wanting by this latest instalment, particularly the final assault on the Starkiller Base, which was completely bereft of tension. In fact, my favourite moment of the whole film is when Carrie Fisher tries to convey anguish, but her plastic surgery doesn't let her."
ID_100021	1	Oh how I miss the style of that awful film called 'The Phantom Menace'.This film has no style. It looks like a joke. Like fan fiction with a big budget. Like a Christmas Special Star Wars reunion on the set of Spaceballs and with villains from Harry Potter or Dr Who. I just don't know what to say. I won't even review the plot (which is a total rip-off of the 1977 Star wars), the acting or the direction. This is a joke. Unwatchable garbage. You know which character I liked? That little robot that follows them around. That's it. The rest are useless.And no, I do not appreciate even more of that 'girl power' nonsense that is still being shoved down our throats. I give these 'Star Wars' zero stars.
ID_100022	10	"My expectations were very, very high for this movie.Starting with the opening scene, a typical Star Wars opening, I wondered how well it was done. I wondered how it would be different and yet new, rebooting some of the old and original without seeming stagnant.JJ delivered on the Star Trek reboot and he absolutely nailed this one as well.He made it his own movie, he engaged original characters by engaging the new and the old. He let the characters tell their own stories without pushing over the boundaries. The story flowed.John Williams does it again. Harrison Ford was spectacular. The newcomers were fun, engaging and ""cheer"" worthy.My only complaint is this: do I really have to wait 2 more years to see the next amazing one directed by Abrams?!Someone pass me the Xanax while I wait, please!!!"
ID_100023	6	If you were expecting something different and better, you will be disappointed with SW7, Force Awakens.The plot seems pretty similar to the previous plots. This young girl Rey seems to have something special. Could she have special Jedi powers? Who is this guy Finn and why did he leave the troopers? It was comfortable to see Chewie and Hans Solo, like putting on a nice comfortable, well- work jacket. But there are chase scenes, and a bad guy who is eerily similar to Darth Vader, with again the father/son angle thrown in. Fighter jets attack a big bad warship. The computer robot has a special role. Does this all sound familiar? Oh, and at the end you are left hanging, knowing that the franchise will continue. Same old same old.Star Wars 7 was nothing special, except the hype, and seeing Harrison Ford again. Otherwise, I think this bridge to the next generation of SW fans might just be a bridge too far. Stick with the Star Trek movies - they are more enjoyable that this retread.
ID_100024	10	Ten out of Ten against the negative whiny fan-boys. This movie is really amazing, and MOST of the world LOVE this film. Box office!!!It is a fun Star Wars ride in every way. It COULD have been worse, but JJ did an amazing job pulling this off. Felt like Star Wars all the way. No one complained in the first few weeks, and then... let the haters go home and leave the rest of the world enjoying this movie Finn and Rey all the way!!!!
ID_100025	6	Was the movie entertaining? Yes, moderately..Did it blow me away? Nope..It is like any other superhero movie(exception: christopher nolan's batman reboot), only this time it happens to be with star wars background, where the lead character does everything ..visuals were good..and music was good in parts..dialogue just OK..There is no depth to any character, neither any intensity in the plot nor gripping narration...it was just beeeeeeeep from start to end..but thats enough to become huge success these days i guess..sad state of Hollywood movies....
ID_100026	10	This movie was fun. From beginning to end, it was a good way to jump start the star wars franchise. While I'm not a JJ Abrams fan at all, and can't stand his Star Trek movies, I also don't like his habit of let's do it because it's cool and never explain a thing, this was a fun movie. The new characters are tremendous and the only complaint I have is that it really brought out the worst in Star Wars fans. There's no such thing as black stormtroopers! How the hell does anyone know that? (I would have liked to know why they stopped using clones). Why a female jedi hero? Why the hell not? Just sit back and enjoy the movie or shut up.
ID_100027	6	SPOILER ALERT: Plot points discussed Entertaining as a stand alone movie, but a huge disappointment for a remakequel. The purpose of this film is to sell toys and to sever all connections with the previous six movies and make it Disney Wars.If you've seen the original, then you've already seen every scene in this one. What was JJ thinking. A forced along plot full of illogical actions. Disney and JJ ripped the fans off big time by just remaking the first one, only with an extra touch of stupidity.JJ took a red lightsaber and shoved up the fans @$! The force was not strong with this one. you can expect the next to films to eliminate all the Lucas Characters - chewy, R2, C3, Luke, Lea, and even admiral Ackbar.
ID_100028	10	Don't let the shrill minority fool you, Star Wars The Force Awakens is one of the greatest films ever set in a galaxy far, far away. J.J. Abrams and Lawrence Kasdan have accomplished what I thought to be impossible: they have resurrected the Star Wars franchise with more life and vigor than ever. From a beautiful story to crackling dialogue that doesn't take itself overly serious, this film is brimming with everything we ever loved about Star Wars. The acting is better than we've ever seen it, with our returning cast, specifically Harrison Ford churning out their best performances yet. My favorite part of the film, however, are the new players. All of the young cast, specifically Adam Driver and Daisy Ridley stun in their respective roles. This film plays as a love letter to fans, and while it's impossible to please everyone in the internet age, as a man who loved the original trilogy long before the prequels, I can assure you that if you consider yourself a real Star Wars fan, you will fall in love with this film. I implore you to see it multiple times. It's gotten better every single time. It's now tied with Empire as my favorite Star Wars film. This film will stand the test of time for generations to come. Thank you J.J. and Kasdan for this gem of a trilogy kickoff!
ID_100029	10	"Star Wars The Force Awakens is a beautiful film. It's the Star Wars film that we've been waiting for for 30 years, the film that the prequels failed to deliver. It is full of gorgeous visuals, memorable characters, and genuinely funny lines but above all, it truly felt like how a Star Wars movie should feel. Wildly entertaining, at no point during the film did I feel removed from the action, or that I was waiting for the next scene to happen. The movie is very fast paced, with very few slow moments. That being said, the action flows together perfectly and somehow manages to never feel rushed. For me, by far the best part of The Force Awakens were the characters. And I don't mean Han, Luke, and Leia. While it was great to see the original three back in action, and Harrison Ford gave another brilliant performance as Han Solo, the ones that really stole the show were the new characters. The story centers around Rey, an independent, resourceful scavenger on the planet Jakku. Rey has clearly endured many hardships throughout her life and yet somehow, she remains hopeful about her future and maintains a strong optimistic attitude. As the movie progresses, we see Rey begin to discover her powers with the force and how to use them. But only towards the end of the film do we realize how powerful she truly is, and I am very excited to see what's in store for her in episodes 8 and 9. Part of what made Rey such a believable, effective character was the spectacular acting performance by Daisy Ridley. No other actor could have done a better job. The majority of the comic relief in this film comes from Finn, an ex storm trooper who encounters Rey in the desert after he crashes while trying to escape the First Order. It was fascinating to see a little inside the life of a storm trooper, something we never really saw in any of the previous films. Finn is equally as believable a character as Rey, and John Boyega's performance was spot on as well. Part of what made these two characters so great was the on screen chemistry between them, something that the prequels failed to deliver with Anakin and Padme.As for Kylo Ren, aka Ben Solo, it was awesome to see such a complex character that has so many layers as the villain. We learn more about Kylo Ren's back story and personality in this one film than we do about Darth Vader in almost all of the original trilogy. The light saber temper tantrums, the side punching, the conversations with Darth Vader's helmet, Kylo Ren is the perfect balance of emotional kid and pure bad-ass. Star Wars The Force Awakens has brought back everything that I loved about the original Star Wars while at the same time, adding an element of mystery that did not exist in the originals. The movie is pure fun to watch and is so entertaining that I didn't notice any of the issues until my second viewing. If a massive grin didn't spread across your face when Han and Chewy burst through the doors of the millennium falcon, or if you didn't get goosebumps when Finn ignited Anakin's light saber for the first time, then you were never a TRUE Star Wars fan to begin with.Facts and even more facts. You're welcome ; )"
ID_100030	10	"I was absolutely sure this was going to be an epic failure after the horrible taste the prequels left us with. I watched the prequels before watching the movie. They were even worse than I remembered them. Atrocious. Unwatchable. The best thing that could ever happen was Disney getting Lucasfilm off George Lucas' hands. George Lucas, thank you for not being involved AT ALL in this movie. You almost destroyed Star Wars with the ""prequels"".But JJ Abrams and Disney... they created a masterpiece. This is movie is so stunning on so many levels I can only compare it to when I was 3 years old and watched Star Wars in a huge movie theater. Goosebumps, chills, the whole deal. This movie feels real, looks real, just like the original trilogy did. This is amazing - I couldn't imagine Disney topping the original trilogy - but in my humble opinion, they did.Disney, JJ Abrams, everyone involved - feel proud about yourselves. You made me forget the prequels ever existed, and made me feel like a 3 year old kid for two hours. Hope the same writers are involved with Episode 8 and find a way to mention that the prequels were ""some sort of mythology that never happened"", then i'll be a happy, true Star Wars fan!t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-TEN!"
