ID_100301	"This movie like most Hollywood movies last few years is devoid of soul, lacking in talent and full of social agendas and pandering to social activist. As a result has left behind the original fans. Little by little the masses are becoming aware of the shallowness of what they are being shown. When a movie is put together by executives whose main objective is money rather than passion for storytelling and the arts this is what you get. The original SWs had a story to tell it created an alternative universe with its own legends heroes and laws. This is why it was so fun to watch. This last episode has destroyed all that and extracted the last glimmer of soul out of it. This director (I forgot his name) did the same with Gene Roddenberry's Star Trek, as well. I don't blame him solely for that, he is after all a small wheel in the hungry corporation that is Hollywood. I am sure he needs permission to scratch his head. As to the feminism that the new movies are pandering to,; it has become so tiresome and predictable that I can not bring myself to watch any more movies out of Hollywood. It all seems to go through the same cookie cutter mold; females have to be unbeatable and need to badmouth men and tough. A little reality will make the female sex more fun to watch. I do dislike the leading role being female, not because of the sex but because of the reason she is there, to prove an unrealistic point. Keep digging Hollywood, I for one and many others I know have better things to do than waste our time with your shallow pastimes. And when we watch movies they are mostly from China, Japan, Europe anywhere but America. They have not been destroyed by shallowness of capitalism and feminism."
ID_100302	J.J Abrams's return to a galaxy far far away is a pleasant one with 'Star Wars: The Force Awakens'. Returning the beloved characters of the Skywalker saga and showing what happened to them.The visuals are beautiful as is John Williams score, the brilliant performances also help with Harrison Ford fully channeling Han Solo, and not a grizzled Harrison Ford. The newcomers are very good as well with John Boyega and Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver. The largest complaint I could even have with this film is the fact that despite the over 30 year wait for an Episode VII we get something very familiar, which is obviously intentional to bring back the feeling of Star Wars to fans, however the film becomes predictable once you see the formula, the film is still fun, and does have new ideas but overall you see the similarities. Despite being a very familiar film, it is heavily filled with fun nostalgia and a Star Wars movie that will leave you feeling like you're a kid again.
ID_100303	It is good and I give it 8/10. I am no fan of J.J. Abrams Star Trek movies but this worked. It has some weak moments and one bad actor that you can never guess beforehand but contrary to my doubts, Daisy Ridley is good and it's miles miles better than the Prequel Trilogy, even Revenge of the Sith.Everything looks real and the lightsaber fights are great. Not like those dancing glowing stick numbers in the prequels. The integration of the legacy actors is done real well and surprised me the most. It went so fast and felt so short. Not one dull moment in this. Even the Original Trilogy had dull moments. I feel this can benefit greatly from an extended cut.This is a great start and a better director can do wonders. This makes the prequels look even worse. Only now you will realize what could have been done.
ID_100304	"I thoroughly enjoyed Episode IV, loved Episode V, thought that Episode VI was enjoyable but too ""kiddy."" I consider episodes I, II, III worthy distractions at best. With the announcement of Episode VII a flicker of hope began to burn. Could JJ and Disney re-ignite what has been considered a world-wide cultural phenomena? Could new characters be introduced that engaged our hearts with emotion and excitement as Luke, Leia, Han, Chewy, Darth and the Droids did? I am writing this to tell you THE FIRE HAS BEEN RE-IGNITED! The Force Awakens has managed to re- kindle the fire of Star Wars. The new characters draw the viewer in and make you care about what happens to them (something Ep. 1-3 failed to do). The connection to the familiar old characters didn't feel forced and made it fun. I can't wait to see Episode VIII! I need to see it! I did not think I would feel that way about Star Wars again. V and V are still my favs, but VII has proved to be the awakening we've been looking for."
ID_100305	"I sat with anticipation, the likes of which I had not felt since the premiere of the Special Edition or Episode I when I was in Middle and High School. The marketing had worked its magic on me and transported me into the haze of nostalgia to prime me for, what I hoped would be, the second coming of Star Wars, delivering us from the wasteland of the prequels which we had been languishing within.Walking out of the theater, I couldn't have been happier. Sure there are little things here and there that I didn't care for but on the whole, everything I love about Star Wars was back.In my review of ""The Last Jedi"" I talk about how much I love that film because it ""brought the force back into Star Wars."" I lament the way that the force is relegated to the role of superpower in the prequels and comment that we get hints of the forces return to prominence in ""The Force Awakens."" Having revisited this film more recently, now, I realize that ""The Force Awakens"" had already done this and brought life back into the franchise.The spirit of Star Wars was lost in the prequel years. Films that had been about the choice between good and evil, the seduction of darkness, and the redemptive power of light became about Visual Effects Fireworks displays, convoluted political plots, and lightsaber fetish inspired dancing. The central questions of the first trilogy are questions of character and motivation not playing plot fill-in-the-blanks or fan service.""The Force Awakens"" returns us to form, where the light vs. dark questions and story of the force are once again central. The turning point of the lightsaber fight at the end of the film turns not on a loss of temper, a flourish of the sword, or a quick thinking characters ideas. It turns, instead, on the moment wherein Rey (Daisy Ridley, ""Murder on the Orient Express"") begins to believe that if she stands up for the light, the light will empower her to defeat Ren (Adam Driver, ""Marriage Story"").I will forgive much of a film for the sake that it has gotten this correct. Luckily, there isn't much for me to forgive because the film is so joyfully and beautifully made.The new characters are great and recapture the young spirit of the originals. We forget that the mains in ""A New Hope"" were kids when they made those movies (Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher, and Harrison Ford) and their youth is apparent in the way they speak to each other, the joking together they engage in, and the spirit of adventure they all share. Daisy Ridley, John Boyega (""Pacific Rim: Uprising""), and Oscar Isaac (""Ex Machina"") are that youth, excitement, zeal, and adventure in this film. Watching Rey and Finn go back and forth about holding hands and who knows more than the other is very reminiscent of Han and Leia. Poe teaching Finn to shoot in the TIE fighter feels like Luke and Han shooting down TIEs in the Millennium Falcon. Rey, longing for meaning and family feels a lot like Luke longing for adventure.For many, these similarities are a negative. They see ""Force Awakens"" as a copy of ""A New Hope."" A lesser copy. I don't see it that way at all. To me, this is a breath of fresh air.On the surface, I can understand how some people, without thinking all that deeply about the subject or perhaps simply parroting reviews they watched online, might see the films as being extremely similar.After all, the protagonists in both films begin on desert planets, a droid holds a secret piece of information in both, they visit a wretched hive of scum and villainy, a super-weapon blows up some planets, the super weapon is destroyed by a single fighter, and a mentor is sacrificed within site of the one they are mentoring. There are loads more correlations but I want to point out that they are all similar only on the surface. Almost in every case, the meanings behind these things are different.Rey may be on a desert planet, but unlike Luke, who wants desperately to get away, she wants to stay. Even once she leaves she wants to go back. Her motivation is exactly the opposite of Luke's and people have the audacity to say that it's basically the same. I could go down the line of the objections pointing out how all of them are simply surface similarity, and if someone wants me to do that, I suppose I could on the podcast, but I don't want to belabor my point here.Let's just say that after watching it over and over, ""The Force Awakens"" is simultaneously reminiscent of the original trilogy but presents similar themes and ideas in new ways. To me, that is a remarkable accomplishment for a filmmaker, especially when considering the size and importance of this film to the studio making it.I simply don't understand how people who loved the original trilogy can watch this film and not like it. It is EXACTLY what this sequel should have been.Except for the rathtars. That sequence blew."
ID_100306	"Although sometimes I wonder if we're so attached to the series that we can overlook a lot of things. I think people who grew up with the series would rate most as at minimum ""Watchable"". Having said that, did not really like I and II very much but Force Awakens was great. I totally Love BB8, he (she?) is the best. Good acting and good plot line. Good combination of drama/SPX/action."
ID_100307	Initially I wasn't going to write a review of Episode VII, but I've just seen a Duracell ad featuring light sabres and it was too much.The Force Awakens is not a bad movie, but it's a pandering to nostalgia, without any courage to explore new ground, motives or motifs. In the attempt to not alienate fans or heaven forbid hurt sales of toys or tie-in products, JJ Abrams rehashed all the key points from the original trilogy. If it were not for BB-8 or Kylo Ren's light sword and the hilt, it would have been devoid of anything original.From the production and directing point of view, there's nothing to reproach to this movie. It's easy to watch, not boring or annoying, but it's utterly unoriginal and a major disappointment in this area. The new characters are bland except maybe for Daisy Ridley's. Adam Driver is completely unconvincing as the villain, John Boyega's Finn could be deleted from the movie without anyone noticing, and as for Han Solo, Harrison Ford delivers, the only bright point in the movie.That's about it. Fans will like it or love it, people new to SW (I know those do exist) can pick up without needing to know the previous films, and it will generate billions in worldwide sales. Mission accomplished. Hopefully JJ will not repeat his inexcusable demolition of the Star Trek franchise. Then again, Star Trek is intelligent and thus can be dumbed down. Star Wars, not so much.
ID_100308	"It was inevitable that they were going to milk the franchise long after the story assumed to be done. ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" brings back the characters from episodes 4-6 and adds some new ones. Given the frequent one-liners and self-references, I get the feeling that the aim is to make all the nerds/geeks have fun. I will say that unlike ""The Phantom Menace"", I understood the plot this time; with the former, I didn't understand the plot until I listened to ""Weird Al"" Yankovic's song ""The Saga Begins"" (a parody of ""American Pie"").So, it's no masterpiece. The plot is mainly two hours of light saber fighting and shooting lasers. Basically, if you go in expecting nothing more than stuff that's meant to appeal to the characters on ""The Big Bang Theory"", then you won't be disappointed. If anything important came out of the movie, I'd say that it's Carrie Fisher's shutting down of people who have nothing better to do than comment on her age.That's all that I have to say about this movie."
ID_100309	Heard so many rave reviews about the new Star Wars movie, watched it tonight and totally disappointed. Well, the fans of the original Star Wars would love it because this is just a redo the original one. I agree with the Audioguys review. JJ paraphrase the original one. You can defend for him to pay tribute to the original SW - New Hope but it just sadly and shamelessly copied the original one. Rey is a scavenger, same as Skywalker. Han Solo went to the bar in the original movie, same here. Princess Lea put the message in R2D2. Now, Poa put it in BB8. The droid took the message to find the Skywalker and lead to Skywalker in the new film. Some of the lines are even carbon copied it. This new SW definitely make tons of money. All I hope JJ will make a more original SW movie in next chapter.
ID_100310	I wanna start by saying that I'm not the biggest Star Wars fan, even though I do enjoy some of the movies more than others. I believe the original trilogy to be a fine series of films and the prequels to be terrible at times but with some good things accomplished at times. Nonetheless, from everything I had seen from the previews for this film, I was definitely anticipating it a lot and I can definitely say that it was quite a birthday present watching this on opening day. The Force Awakens was entertaining, it set up new characters terrificly and brought back the beloved heroes of the first three movies in a respectable way.With this new installment, we follow Rey (Ridley) a scavenger that has her life changed when a droid named BB-8 has an important message for a resistance fighting what rose from the fall of the Galactic Empire, the First Order. She must now deliver this message with the help of Finn (Boyega), a storm trooper that has managed to escape the First Order and Han Solo. With the First Order we will get a new villain in Kylo Ren, a Sith in training shrouded with mystery, and could ultimately play a big part in these character's lives.For me, the franchise is now in great hands as Daisy Ridley and John Boyega were wonderful in their roles and could very well be the big heroes for this new generation that Luke, Han & Leia were for the first viewers of this saga. I thought Abrams held his own in the directing department and delivered a quite competent job. The effects were on point and the movie as a whole was a fantastic piece of entertainment.As far as I'm concerned, this movie brings back Star Wars in a big way. It's not a perfect movie by any means, but its definitely quite a experience and I can see only very nit picky people not enjoying it. Having said that, I hope you really enjoy the experience like I did, if you do choose to watch it. and may The Force be with you.Rating: 9/10
ID_100311	This is literally the most beautiful film in the series. The tight shots and cinematography leave the audience with iconic, wondrous, and haunting images that stay emblazoned in one's mind. Yes, the protagonist seems a little too perfect, some of the lines are heavy handed, and some exposition of new characters seemed wanting, but the movie delivers with fast-paced movement and taps into an uncanny feeling of nostalgia for something you've never seen before by showing respect for the original films while inverting characters in new ways.
ID_100312	...., mainly because there are distinct references to relevant back stories in this film, tying certain characters together, concerning the 30 years since all events in the last movies, as there was in the original 3 movies, in relation to Darth Vader on that occasion. In order to tell these new stories fully they would have to sandwich movies in the middle of Return of the Jedi and Force Awakens, but of course they don't need to do that, allowing our own imagination to fill in the gaps, in much the same way fans, casual or otherwise, did upon first watching the original trilogy way back when, as indeed this movie does too. So, I would like to suggest that the prequels are now redundant. Having just watched the original trilogy, without all the extra gumph George Lucas tacked on to it for DVD and Bluray, seeing it in all it's VHS glory, the Force Awakens feels as though it really does belong to the original narrative, and works very well as a story occurring 30 years later. Much of that is attributed to the way this movie was filmed, using a lot of practical effects, as opposed relying entirely on CGI. There was something, I won't say what that 'something' was, that really did disappoint me, leaving me quite shocked, however in retrospect, later, I was able to appreciate all other aspects of the movie, character development, story progression, etc, and began to question if I really needed what I thought I was going to, and wanted to see.
ID_100313	I just got home from seeing it. Definitely was a great movie, a great star wars movie. First thing I want to outline, which is not really spoilerific, that there were a few things from the trailers that did not make it to the final cut. Although J.J.'s lens flares did appear (obviously) quite a lot of times, the first thing to praise is the visuals, especially the intro's visual. Also later on, all the various settings were well cured. Surely the force was strong with the direction of this film. Next on, acting of the actors. That was great. Everyone just did the best he/she could, which was fantastic. Now the most important thing in a star wars movie, besides having stunning visual effects (Wich were just really the best in this film) is the story. Many ones hated the prequels for that, and praised the originals for having great stories. Episode VII has definitely both the best story and plot and the best backstory. The 30 years of period after VI got well covered, episode VII has a lot of great elements which expanded the galaxy really well. Definitely old EU fans will see a lot of new things they won't dislike. What homever bothers and bothered me was the music. It's john williams, you can hear it, but sound more like Indiana Jones and the kingdom of the crystal skull's and harry potter's score. That's strange to be seen on a star wars film. So... overall this was a great film that earns my respect. J.J. Abrams won't be called Jar Jar Abrams
ID_100314	As I watched this, I was getting bored. Even some of the big action sequences didn't catch me. When I had left I realised why, I had seen it all before in the other installments. It didn't seem like there was anything new about The Force Awakens at all. A few scenes felt unneeded or could have at least been shortened. Some characters just seemed like fillers. I am not looking forward to the rest anymore. Maybe don't watch it or get too excited if you have seen the other Star Wars movies copious amounts.Something needs to be done about the rest of the trilogy if anything great can be said about them. So far it is dull.
ID_100315	"Wow! ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" just became the Best Star Wars movie ever made since 38 years ago. George Lucas started from the very beginning, and now he's back, of going phase 3, for the new Star Wars movie, and somehow J.J. Abrams is involved with Episode VII. He did a brilliant job in Star Wars: Episode VII, I would have to say he should stick with directing, and producing Star Wars movies instead of Star Trek, I'm more of a Star Wars fan like everybody else who loves Star Wars. J.J. Abrams and George Lucas, great job and I hope you'll do a great job making Star Wars feel the force awaken again. May the force be with you. Always."
ID_100316	"Being a long time fan of the original, prequel, and the EU I came into this movie expecting at movie that was sub par at best compared to the original trilogy but no. This film was far better than I could have anticipated! The almost spine chilling performance of Adam Driver (Kylo Ren) Daisy Ridley (Rey) and John Boyega (Finn) is superb and can keep up with the original stars like Harrison ford (Han Solo) and Carrie Fisher (General Leia/ Princess Leia). The plot might have been a little sloppy at some moments when plot devices required it but the tension you feel in the movie is so moving. My feelings after the film have caused me to feel a mix of despair and love. Anyone who doesn't cry at least 3 times while watching this movie has no soul at all, that I can guarantee. This movie rocked me so hard that I had to sit at my local theater for 20 minutes afterwards so I could process all that happened and stop my hand from furiously shaking. EU plot points, great story elements, bone chilling acting are all part of your package deal my friends and I will be going back to see it another 3-5 times. I love this movie and it just barely beats ""Empire Strikes Back"". Thanks for reading if you found this helpful please like and go see the movie NOW!"
ID_100317	"Welcome from Michael Lai's Magical Movie Reviews: ""Ahhhhhh!"" That's the sound you'll hear from the majority of Star Wars fans around the world breathing a huge sigh of relief. This is what Star Wars was meant to be, qualities not exhibited in Episodes I and II...characters you cared for, exciting action pieces not dominated by CGI, engaging plot twists and revelations plus a story that doesn't become bogged down with too much technical exposition. It's a combination of the old and the new with characters we remember and love from the original trilogy as well as new characters that have their chance to breathe a life of their own. We have the chance to reminisce with our beloved characters yet be intrigued by what will happen with the new characters. These characterizations ultimately drive the story with the action scenes helping deliver a spectacular and rewarding two hours plus of fun-filled entertainment.Set three decades after the death of the Emperor, Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) has vanished and the Resistance led by General Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher), is trying desperately to locate him before the First Order led by Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis) captures him, thus eliminating the main threat to their galactic dominance. Second in command is a Darth Vader figure in Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) who also has Force-like powers like his idol. The droid, BB8, has been entrusted with the map of the location of Luke. BB8's companion is Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac), the best fighter pilot in the Resistance. Poe is captured by the First Order but his escape is assisted by a Stormtrooper in Finn (John Boyega). Meanwhile, BB8 is separated from his companion and winds up in the company of Rey (Daisy Ridley), a young woman living on a desert planet, who is hunting for spare parts to trade for food, just so she can survive. Finn and Rey eventually team up with each other along with old favorites like Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew).This is the ultimate homage to the original Star Wars trilogy, which some people might complain about as playing it too safe. J.J. Abrams, the director and co-writer of the film, employs traits such as the slide swipe and 'eye' closing between some scenes, but it is this familiarity which will endear him to Star Wars fans. There are several scenes and plot points which you know you have seen before but you can forgive Abrams for doing this as it doesn't alienate the Star Wars fans. As a stand alone film and not comparing it to the original trilogy, it attracts the audience. For that, Abrams deserves credit for bringing in a new legion of fans. He also maintains an up-tempo rate, ensuring that there is never a dull moment. We are emotionally invested in the characters. Daisy Ridley is a newcomer worth keeping an eye on because she portrays the heroine with conviction. Her scenes with Boyega are engaging and they make us care for the fate of their characters, something that wasn't always evident in the rapport between Hayden Christensen and Natalie Portman in the CGI trilogy. Harrison Ford appears in quite a fair bit of the film and shows here how much his acting has improved since the 1977 original. The major villain in Kylo Ren is brilliantly portrayed by Adam Driver and he capably exhibits the rage and angst his character is experiencing.The abundance of CGI which detracted from the first three episodes is thankfully not in evidence here. It's a return to what made the visual effects so special in Episodes IV, V and VI. There are CGI characters (more like motion capture) like Snoke and Maz Kanata (Lupita Nyong'o) but they're never as annoying as Jar Jar Binks was. Kudos also to the sound effects team for bringing all those space vehicles to life. You'll feel like you're involved in the action. Other technical aspects to flourish include the superior set decoration, costume design, cinematography and editing, all contributing to the overall pleasures of this movie. Who could forget to mention the score by John Williams? Star Wars and John Williams go hand in hand and again, he has fashioned a score that is exciting and atmospheric. He is a living treasure and we must appreciate every score he composes, now that he is close to the end. As a side note, this is the first Star Wars film not released by 20th Century Fox and it's sad to not hear the 20th Century Fox fanfare that introduces a Star Wars movie. It's a good thing though that Disney, the studio that has acquired the rights from George Lucas, didn't include its usual ""When You Wish Upon a Star"" tune and the image of the fireworks above the castle to introduce the film. Those iconic words to begin a Star Wars film...""A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away"" will give you goosebumps. Disney plans to release a new Star Wars film in 2017. If the adventures of these characters, both and old and new are anything to go by, the next sequel promises to be an exciting chapter in the Star Wars franchise. The hype won't be as big for that installment but the hype for Episode VII has certainly been justified. http://mlaimlai2.wix.com/magical-movie-review"
ID_100318	I put 6 because of the jokes pull in the movie otherwise it would be a 5.The biggest question I have in mind is how an untrained girl can defeat a villain warlord who has years of training. Luke had training for years, Anakin had training for years. Rey had none... she did not need it.The message is if you are an independent girl you can defeat a whoever you want even without practice, just believe it.Looks like Disney and Abrams want to sell toys to girls also in order to make more money and to do that they have to twist star wars agenda to the extreme. Even Fin could stand against that villain without saber practice. In the second part I am expecting other minorities to save the universe.Perfectly disappointing.
ID_100319	STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Luke Skywalker has mysteriously vanished, leaving the Resistance in dire straits. In his absence, the First Order, lead by the evil Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), have begun implementing their will with force. Finn (John Boyega), a disillusioned Storm Trooper, absconds from his post, and joins forces with Rey (Daisy Ridley), a feisty female warrior who has in her company BB8, a droid who may hold the key to Skywalker's whereabouts. The pair are joined by Han Solo and Chewbacca in their mission as it progresses.While I've never been the biggest Star Wars devotee, I have always admired it for the great, epic film that it was, and always found it incredible how something like that could have been produced so many decades ago. Over the years, the series has certainly attracted a lot of followers, and while a lot of people have bemoaned the craze of grown adults blatantly exhibiting their passion in public, in a sense it has recreated a sense of community and kinship that a trip to the cinema has lacked for many years. The publicity for JJ Abrams big screen re-invention has certainly been pretty relentless, and you'd certainly have felt left out not going on the big opening weekend.One of the key themes of this big venture is exploring one of the Storm Troopers as a human being (they were all robots, as far as I was concerned!) and the examination of conscience that gets provoked in one of them. This creates a character ark that serves as a reference point to the story, and gives it some flair. With the fans spanning over so many years, it was necessary to create something that appealed to old and young, and so we have younger stars Ridley and Boyega, whilst returning old favourites Carrie Fisher and Harrison Ford, reprising the second of the two roles that made his name. None human old favourites C-3PO and R2-D2 return too, along with the aforementioned BB8, who resembles a Kinder Egg on wheels.The dialogue's still leaves a bit to be desired, and all the mass publicity in the world won't create any more super fans than there already are, but as a SW venture, this ticks all the right boxes, a full on, full scale epic that delivers all the marvellous effects, set design, breath-taking action and just everything you'd expect from the franchise. ****
ID_100320	Almost every elements looks so familiar to A New Hope. Too familiar. Everything is just the same. This movie is a cash-grab type of movie. JJ abrams, I hate you.
ID_100321	From a neutral perspective i would say its an OK movie. However the plot is mostly just a copy of Episode IV's plot. I didn't mind that the movie was a bit predictable, since the movie is still a Disney production - therefore also meant for children. But i did miss the force in all the fights - why not use it more, if you have it? The new characters had a decent enough backstory, but the lack of depth in the story was painful. If someone told this was supposed to be the best movie of all time, i would burst out laughing - it doesn't even deserve to be in the top 250 - Unfortunately the Screenwriters aren't as talented as the marketing managers of Disney.
ID_100322	Almost nobody rated over 3. HOW THE HELL 8.0 RATE??!
ID_100323	"First and foremost: I would like for you to read my review of ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens""; but remember I don't like to leave my hand solo without writing puns in movie reviews. For those two or three humanoids who still have not seen ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"", I promise not to play the part of Darth Spoiler in my review of this riveting installment of what is probably the most popular movie franchise of all time. ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" is set around 40 years after ""The Return of the Jedi"". Three decades after the defeat of the Galactic Empire, a new threat arises. The First Order attempts to rule the galaxy and only a rag-tag group of heroes can stop them, along with the help of the Resistance. Director J.J. Abrams definitely was not spaced out with his orchestration of the movie, as he brilliantly incorporates the vintage Star Wars elements, with an invigorated new narrative. It involves a fugitive stormtrooper named Finn, who wants to put a fin to his trooper-served time; I guess he wasn't a real stormtrooper. And a pretty scavenger named Rey, who is really the reigning character of the movie; let's just say Rey's role is as pivotal as it comes in a Star Wars flick. Now for the Old School of Star Wars; yes there are sightings of classic Star Wars characters and several are imperative in the film's narrative, But I will not be the only-one can-open the secrets of their roles in this installment; I will say that young actors Daisy Ridley as Rey and John Boyega as Finn conducted forceful performances; the pressure was on and they delivered. Now to the dark side, which would come in the form of the primary villain here- Kylo Ren portrayed with edgy fierce by Adam Driver. Yea, he bad, yea, he loves the Darth. Come on, it's the dark side, what you expect! A few other laser points before I depart the Pun Star: Harrison Ford is back with his exceptionally clever badass wit with his work as Mr. Solo, and Carrie Fisher was gently effective as the former Princess now General Leia. And then there is that Luke dude.... So anyways, may the puns be with you; and yea, don't forget to watch this little space flick, if you haven't already. ***** Excellent"
ID_100324	"I just got back from the cinema. My gut tells me 10/10, of course! That was kind of obvious when feeling the hype that's been raining all over the internet these last few weeks. But where to begin, when I try to describe my emotions after watching it?Maybe I can start off with this: Star Wars fans, old and new, you will most assuredly feel a chill spreading through your body and warming your heart when you see Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher and Mark Hamill on the big white screen again, resulting in goosebumps arising on your skin while your heart pumps just a little faster from the joy. It was truly amazing to see all of these three actors back in action again. It's just so delightful to see that age isn't necessarily an obstacle for being the star of a legendary world class movie (which can gross $238.000.000 in one day.) Moving on, of course we can not forget the phenomenal new additional characters to the Star Wars franchise: Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, Oscar Isaac and Adam Driver just to mention the most important ones. I am so happy that these are the people who were casted to revive the Star Wars universe once again after a second long break (luckily, I am from the 90s, so I only had to endure one of them.) But maybe it was all for the best though; to give the franchise time to manifest itself in us for generations (talking about both my father, grandfather and me for instance.) Anyway, this new cast must also get a very big applause for their excellent work and for not being too intimidated by the franchise due to what it has become today.I would say the movie perfectly unites the original Star Wars trilogy (4-6) with the latter Star Wars movies (1-3) by recasting the SAME brilliant actors (who are still acting brilliant, despite their age) and introducing fresh, new and young actors who so eloquently live up to the high standards of their predecessors.Of course, you will also get to see the epic, mandatory light saber duel, which in this movie at least keeps up with the recent Star Wars movies. Whether or not it is as good as the Anakin vs. Obi-Wan duel on Mustafar is up to you to decide, but personally I think this one added a nice extra element to it. At last, I feel obligated to mention that Star Wars fans all over the world will be thrilled to notice certain familiar elements from the past movies (like a certain light saber perhaps; that is in no way a spoiler by the way) and much other stuff, which I will gladly send you in to watch by fully recommending it to you.So grab your family or friends and head to the movies as long as it's still on in the cinema."
ID_100325	"Finally there is a new Star Wars movie. This movie is easy to sum up without spoiling it. It is a roller-coaster ride throughout the whole movie. And yes, there are (a lot) of elements that summon a déjà vu. But those elements made us fall in love with Star Wars in the first place and once again it made me fall in love with ""The Force Awakens"". I saw it yesterday in IMAX and I am still shaking. This is my first review because I owe it to JJ. I just want to let people know to go and watch this. And form your own opinion! Don't let negative people influence your judgment...Pessimism is a path to the dark side. Stay true and may the Force be with you."
ID_100326	Gave it a 2 after first viewing, but after a 2nd look I've changed my mind. i picked up on things I missed first time which has helped produce a more objective review. jj had to squeeze so much into this film to assist with the development of the next 2. he had to appeal to 2 sets of viewers - traditional fans whilst introducing new fans to the universe, a difficult balance, but think he just about did it. its exciting, it moves at pace and harrison ford and daisy ridley are excellent. I still have some issues with it, for instance i wish we weren't dealing with another death star, but there are also plenty of mysteries yet to unveil.I'm not a star trek fan and I went to see the new star trek films with star trek fans, they were disappointed on first viewing but I loved them. this is the same. go with a child's eyes without the past to colour your judgement and you'll feel better about judging it on its own merits.
ID_100327	Star Wars: Force Awakens is one HIGHLY entertaining film and deserves tons of praise and recognition for successfully creating an exhilarating new chapter in the saga. Its cleverness & sheer novelty is sure to create a new generation of fans, & its homage to familiar icons affectionately resounds to long time enthusiasts. In amazing fashion, JJ Abrams also injects renewed energy throughout the film's runtime, resulting to a humor-filled, heart-racing experience like no other. Episode VII then, checks all the boxes, on what a resounding Star Wars sequel should be.Casting & character development is undoubtedly the film's best asset. John Boyega as Fin was such a huge win, as his eagerness and joy to be part of this film resonates in the energy of his character. His delivery was perfect, providing SERIOUS comedic punch, a pleasant & welcome surprise to the franchise. Daisey Ridley as Rey was also a fine as wine choice. Her portrayal was very real & natural, so much so that her action sequences and sentimental scenes, were effortless. By far, she is the film's heart & soul. Deserving recognition, the chemistry between the two aforementioned leads was through the roof. Their friendship felt heartfelt & genuine, and a quirk I was personally rooting for. The plot's progression through both leads, was very engaging too as they were given unique & rich backstories, and grounded motivations. Oscar Isaac as Poe was another solid casting. He oozes with righteous passion & intensity, and his scenes are electric & inspiring even. This paves the way for the audience to regard his skill & stature as entertainingly believable. Now, of course, the reprisal of Harrison Ford as Han Solo, and the inclusion of Chewie and the Millennium Falcon is THE highlight of all highlights. Amazingly, their comeback was far from being forced as their characters were given substantial roles that were integral to the storyline, steering clear from shallow fan service. Finally, we have Adam Driver who played the intimidating Kylo Ren exceptionally. His evil was haunting yet his motivations are clear and understandable, a recipe of success for any film villain.Apart from the human-factor of the film, JJ Abrams also made it a point to present Force Awakens, as a visual spectacle. The sites & landscapes were alluring, from lush forests to icey mountain sides, every location was a beaut. The action sequences was very well made and executed too, adding hearth thumping battles to complement its well thought of storyline. During dialogues, JJ Abrams also displays his directing prowess by using perfectly timed focus & pauses during sincere and emotion-filled exchanges, adding drama at the right moments.As for its shortcomings, one significant flaw that I found from Force Awakens, is its unashamed mimicry of A New Hope. Without giving away spoilers, the resemblance is uncanny. The overall un-original storyline is worry-some as fresh faces & copy pasted narratives could be a dangerous combination. This though, is a problem for its sequels. Taken as stand alone film, Episode VII was as fun & resounding as they come despite the re-hash of former ideas.Overall, this is a FANTASTIC Star Wars reboot. Every scene is brimming with energy that there is little time to breathe in between. The roles of the new and old characters were very well written & I for one, am genuinely in awe as to how these first-seen faces became overnight mainstream favorites. Cant wait for the Episode VIII and IX! Awesome job by Disney and JJ Abrams!
ID_100328	"I won't get bogged down discussing the blatant political correctness of ""The Force Awakens"" (God forbid I offend someone) and it is not really necessary to point out the obvious, but what I will say on the get-go here is that I was suckered in to the irresistible nostalgic buzz that the film offered upon it's release in 2015. Like many people, ""Star Wars"" was my childhood. So I needed a more neutral viewing some years later to really give this film the once-over. In a nutshell, I've come to the conclusion that ""The Force Awakens"" is a poor film but with a nostalgic vibe that carries it along and makes it seem to be a far better film than it really is. Nonetheless, I give it a decent rating, purely for Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher and Mark Hamill. The film is shamelessly a scene-by-scene remake of ""A New Hope""; Luke Skywalker is now a young woman and Darth Vader is Kylo Ren. And the Death Star even has a replacement. The Empire is now The New Order... I could go on, but at the risk of giving this a lower rating. Overall, this is purely one for the die-hard fans that needed the nostalgic lift a years ago. But now, and in future, I believe it will be completely forgotten about and relegated to being the lesser of the franchise, even worse than ""Attack of the Clones""."
ID_100329	That is the conclusion I came up with by the end of this new Star Wars. Long gone are the years, when as a kid, I went with my Mum and my sister to watch the Return of the Jedi. I was at the time intrigued by the Force, the Millennium falcon, Han Solo, and of course Darth Vader. But of all this, very little remains. Darth Vader well and truly gone, Han Solo is too old, the force has become weak and the Millennium Falcon is more than ever a piece of junk. This movie is obviously for Star Wars lovers. I always thought I was one, and maybe I am not. I have watched all of them from episode 1 to 7, and will continue to do so for how long as a new one is released, but unless I start watching them again with the eyes of a child, I doubt I will enjoy them the way I would like.
ID_100330	The original Star Wars trilogy didn't amaze on plot lines, didn't amaze on dialogue, didn't amaze on ideas. But they did have genuine on screen chemistry and a sense of wide eyed wonder provided by the directors and actors. Even with the prequel trilogy the directing and acting at least felt connected (although too often infantilized) to the original trilogy. And the stories showed they were made by people familiar with the original trilogy.But this?First, as many other reviewers have noted, the plot simply doesn't make sense after the ending of episode VI. It feels simply like a slightly remixed remake reboot. Now, if Star Wars had been only moderately successful and rarely repeated then fine, this approach may have been worthwhile. But this is Star Wars! The most widely known films of all. So what were the creators thinking? If they'd gone even more infantile then OK, maybe it would be a reboot for the very young, too young to have watched the originals. But they didn't. They went more aggressive, so if anything for older viewers than the original. It simply doesn't make any sense, let along the US$millions of sense it took to make.Second, regardless of this, it is simply a weak film, lacking in motivations, consequences or any snappy chemistry, save for one 5 second piece toward the end of the film.The only redeeming features are the special effects (but anyone can do this now) and art direction, but even that is simply decent rather than good.I gave this a view after wasting 2 and a quarter hours on Rogue One and thinking surely no, the good reviews for Ep VII must mean something. I was mistaken.
