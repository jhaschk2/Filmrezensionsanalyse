ID_100061	10	Finally Star Wars is back in full force! Beautiful acting, stunning practical effects and a great story. Now that the theme has been set, there are a lot of paths which the next installments could go down. My only complaint is that 2 hours and 15 minutes went by so damn quick that it felt like barely 30 minutes and I wanted MORE! XD. All in all this makes for a great Star Wars.
ID_100062	10	I have no idea why there is so much hate on this movie. This is one of my favorite movies ever! This passed the original by an absolute landslide! There are three very critical reasons why it is better than the original:1) Better effects - Obviously the effects are going to surpass the original because of the time difference.2) Better plot - In the original, the plot was......fine, but this one brings a whole new level of greatness 3) The New Jedi - Not going to say who it is, but I love this person a lot!All in all, I would definitely recommend watching this amazing movie!!!
ID_100063	10	"I vaguely remember my first introduction to Star Wars. My uncle had taken me with his family to see some horror flick at the Drive-in about a ship that needed to kill people in order to keep the engine running; I seem to remember grey uniforms and it might have a gun ship of some kind? I don't remember too well; I was young, it was gross, and so I didn't pay attention. Looking out the back window of the station wagon, I saw the opening scenes of Empire Strikes Back. I spent the rest of the time entranced, even without having any sound. My first ""grown up"" movie in a normal theater was Return of the Jedi. My mom had the Beta disks. I wore them out. I had the tape series. I wore it out. twice. Then, the movies were re-released. And altered. And the death spiral of the series began.Most everyone complains about how annoying the prequels were. I was more wondering how they ever got made with so much blatant bigoted stereotyping. I have a thick skin for that sort of stuff, and I was starting to get offended. On top of very thoroughly documented complaints already raised against those rejects.But this.... This brought back all the wonder, all the excitement of that little 5 year old looking through the back window, so many years ago. This IS the sequel we have been waiting 30 years for. And it was worth the wait.Old school effects mixed with CGI, the classic musical score, a director that knew where to go and why, actors new enough to push their roles, while still experienced enough to successfully play them. Just enough questions answered to leave you fulfilled, while several obviously still await answers.This is all we hoped for."
ID_100064	10	Just saw Star Wars: The Force Awakens. Having seen all the movies at least one time each, The Force Awakens was exactly what I wanted it to be. A nod at the aging characters of the original trilogy and the setup for the next two movies. I typically do not write reviews, I just have to say I get such a kick out of the people that give this movie a low rating and share their vitriol filled breakdown of the film. I suppose it is why I only tune in for the first two weeks of American Idol, it's funny to watch a bunch of people lacking talent shaking their fists at why their vision of truth is not accepted by the masses.The damage you funny reviewers have done must be very disappointing to JJ Abrams and Co. And last I checked the overall IMDb rating is an oh-so low 8.1. (AKA ridiculously high by IMDb rating standards) Again, simply hilarious!
ID_100065	10	Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens is an incredible reboot/sequel that successfully combines the new with the old in an emotional, consistently funny and thrilling revitalisation of the Skywalker saga. Daisy Ridley, John Boyega and Oscar Isaac are all incredible. Adam Driver is also incredible as Kylo Ren, the franchise's most interesting and compelling villain. Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher are also incredible with their returning characters having grown and evolved since episode VI. It's expertly paced without a single scene dragging or being boring. The music by John Williams is once again reliably perfect. J. J. Abrams' direction is excellent and the film is visually stunning with excellent CG. It also has a fantastic lightsaber fight.
ID_100066	8	Yes, the action and cgi are good. Sadly the movie drowns in it and leaves no room for the Star Wars story. As some other reviewer already pointed out, yes it is a remake of part IV. When part I came out the audience was not happy, they missed something. How is it possible that one can watch part 4 - 6 every year, part 1 - 3 every couple of years and part VII once every 10 years? Same thing with all the other movies like Star Trek: the future begins, the Tranformers trilogy, the latest Avanger movies, when does one get tired of 2 hours only action, action and more action? This movie just does not have the George Lucas touch, it is another mainstream brave Disney family action movie. Part 4 - 6 had some pretty daring scenes, Leila in exciting cloths, this movie everyone is wrapped from head to toe, so damn brave it makes you sick. I conclude to say it's another victim of Disney.
ID_100067	10	"I'm a veeeeery long-term Star Wars fan, since back in '77.The Force Awakens was absolutely brilliant - everyone in the IMAX cinema clapped and cheered at the end. And it was a mixed audience too, not just Star Wars nerds like myself.I would describe this movie as a Star Wars that's real and gritty - I felt immersed in every scene, and not once was the spell broken, unlike the tragic prequels.The acting was superb, cinematography was amazing, and I could never tell when CGI was being used! Story was excellent with some unexpected twists, music great as always, action sequences were breathtaking. Everyone in the cinema was quite emotional by the end. I don't know how some people are giving this a low rating, they must be paid trolls getting that big payola payday from someone. LOL just kidding, that's literally the single dumbest thing i've ever heard. XDLooking forward to watching this again and again!Thanks J.J. for coming through ; )"
ID_100068		"*contains a good few spoilers!* I felt an initial thrill when the title screen and music came up, yet, despite some pleasing tense moments when I was on the edge of my seat, the well-worn familiarity made this whole film nothing more than a pleasant sepia amble down memory lane – a rehash of all I fondly remembered from the old days before everything went wrong and became a dry politics show/pantomime with Yoda leaping about in a fashion most unbecoming of a Jedi Warrior of his stature.So anyway, yep, we've seen it all before. The plot was tired and a bit straggly, like Mark Hamil's beard. Luke had apparently buggered off for some reason or other, and the Resistance needed to find him before the First Order did because hey, it's Luke man, and his Jedi Warrior status was the stuff of legend. In the meantime, naturally, they need to blow up a massive weapon that utilises the power of the sun to destroy stuff. How? By employing the cunning machinations of a very handy janitor who happens to know a thing or two about shield generators, they pop in and switch off the pesky shield like it's child's play and do what they do best, go in and bomb the heck outta the thing. Sorted.I found there to be too many plot holes to be satisfying. Why the force was so strong in the scavenger, Rey, for instance and without any training. Her lineage was not explained - if she's not a relative of someone with suitable Jedi leanings, it doesn't fit. The ease in which the Resistance penetrated enemy lines, battled and won was so easy as to feel like a redundant part of the plot. Although it was nice to see a nod to the original cast, they felt tired and redundant and the newbies didn't convince me. The new BB-8 bot reminded me strongly of Sooty the glove puppet (except less memorable) – alas he didn't hold anywhere near the magic of R2D2. General Leia Organa – what to say? Sweet as it was that she came back, her attire and countenance made her look more suited to a middle-class countryside lifestyle of pheasant shooting than of anything approaching being a working General. Kylo Ren as a wannabee Darth Vadar also fell short of being convincing, and he pranced and minced across the stage in a most un-Darth-like, manner. He'd have been stronger without the mask and the voice synthesiser; he has arresting facial features that would have packed more of a punch than the mask, which just made me compare him to Darth and it didn't work; he was like Darth's camp alter ego; a Frank N. Furter from the Rocky Horror Show (I think Adam Driver would make a *great* Frank N. Furter).So whilst I enjoyed it, I would rather have been left with 4,5 & 6 intact in my memory; with the stronger, far more charismatic, original actors playing vibrant, key roles. (Perhaps I do Rey a disservice – but the mythology of Han Solo and Leia is so great that any new actors seeking to take the baton need to be really strong in their own right – and I just didn't feel the force in her – I did quite like the character of Finn however.) Han Solo and Leia served as a misty-eyed nod to the good old days when characters were charismatic and the plots were less threadbare.Newcomers to the scene and younger people will probably love this – but to me it seems to exemplify all the things wrong with Hollywood, tired & creaky old franchises with ridiculous amounts of sequels that leech any remaining fragments of originality and credibility. It's alright, but stripped of the hype; instantly forgettable."
ID_100069	10	This is actually better than the originals i love all star wars films but im watching back the originals and honestly they are so boring the prequels and the new sequel trilogy so far are way better honestly this film is better than a new hope and honestly its not even that much of a remake its kinda different there are some bits the same but this is way better than all 3 of the originals. So people who are saying this is rubbish ur just being ungrateful coping what those few other people are saying and making up little stories bout other people hating it because your all low lifes this is one of the best star wars films only behind ROTS and LJ. Plus most people who watched this film obviously love it because it made like over 2 billion in the box office and raked even more money when dvd was released
ID_100070	8	"I really don't care what anyone has to say because I personally thought this film was nearly flawless. Sure, it's hard to say that it wasn't a clone of ""A New Hope"", but honestly, it's hard not to go back to old material. The Force Awakens was a thrilling and delectably exciting film that introduced us to fun and loveable new characters (BB8, I'm talking to you!), while simultaneously embracing the original characters. The film got us absolutely pumped for the next film which was an unfortunate misfire, but didn't matter at the time because of how good this one was.A+"
ID_100071	10	I purposely waited 24 hours before writing my review because I wanted to digest the film that long to truly take it in and reflect before I actually reviewed it. I wanted the euphoria of seeing the next chapter of the saga on the big screen to subside some so that I can make an objective review, but alas the euphoria has not subsided and the childlike excitement is still at an 11! This is plain and simply a great Star Wars film! In fact, I feel it is the second best offering of the franchise (behind 'The Empire Strikes Back'). From the opening crawl to the epic and somewhat moving final scene the movie kept you on the edge of your seat. Even now, 24 hours later, I'm still left in awe of what Abrams has done. He has ignited a passion in me that has lied dormant for a decade thanks to the dreadful prequel trilogy. After Episode III I vowed never to see another George Lucas Star Wars film ever again. The prequels were cheesy (and not in a good way) and lacked imagination. They borrowed heavily from the expanded universe (which flies in the face of his original assertion that he had planned out the prequels before Episode IV was even made) and spat in the face of Star Wars fans everywhere. Lucas is now (thankfully) out of the picture and in steps admitted Star Wars fan J.J. Abrams who is quickly establishing himself as this generations Steven Spielberg. Abrams intention was to reignite the franchise and call upon his own boyhood wonderment when seeing the original trilogy for the first time and try to recreate that with the sequel by meshing old and new to weave a new chapter in the saga. What Abrams has done so well here is he's managed to keep the older cast members relevant while also creating new characters who feel like they've always been part of the story. He's been able to expertly bridge the generation gap and bond the older cast members with the new ones to create a cohesive story that is not only enjoyable to watch, but really FEELS like a Star Wars film from the epic battle scenes, music, costumes, sets - every part of the film, even down to the bits and pieces that Rey scavenges oozes STAR WARS and it is fantastic. I won't delve into the plot for fear of spoiling it, but the film obviously revolves around a core of new characters in the Star Wars Universe - Rey, a young scavenger who lives on the desert planet of Jakku, Finn a former Stormtrooper who is desperate to escape the clutches of The First Order, Poe Dameron the top fighter pilot of the Resistance and his trusty droid BB-8, and Kylo Ren, a member of the First Order and a wannabe Sith who acts as the main antagonist of the film. There are other supporting cast including General Hux, a First Order General, Captain Phasma, the leader of the Stormtroopers, Maz Kanata, a pirate and collector of artifacts, and Supreme Leader Snoke who is the leader of the First Order. Several former characters are weaved into the film with Han Solo and Chewbacca seeing the majority of the screen time from that group. The connection between old and new is a constant theme in the film and it is pulled off masterfully. The film is an emotional roller-coaster from beginning to end and is a movie that I will always cherish thanks to it's re- ignition of my love for the franchise. There isn't much more that I can say other than if you are even remotely a fan of the Star Wars Universe you owe it to yourself to see this. Even if you are not, there is a lot to keep you entertained here and you never know, it may turn you into a fan of the franchise if you're not careful, regardless quit reading this and go see it!
ID_100072	10	I simply can not comprehend how anyone would give this a bad review! It was, without a doubt, brilliant. The directing was amazing, to the point where you're so immersed in the scenes, I actually felt giddy during some of the flight scenes. The special effects are tastefully done, and are a perfect follow on from its predecessors. Nostalgia rules in this thrilling film, we felt like applauding several times throughout, and got goosebumps in some amazing scenes. It was also surprisingly humorous, (in appropriate amounts), and the balance of new characters vs returning characters and story lines was brilliant. 10 out of 10 for me. Go see it, you won't regret it.
ID_100073	6	"Return of the Jedi had a solid ending and to continue this story you have to do better than (spoiler alert) give us no context in A New Hope Reboot that just happens to say Episode VII The force Awakens.There aren't any planets we haven't seen before. Jakku is Tatooine with war machines that crash landed on it's surface.(Spoiler Alert) A Coruscant TYPE planet get's destroyed along with 5 other planets with the Death Star 3 that takes energy from the sun. It get's blown up in the same way. All of our hero's efforts in the Original Trilogy is undone.The effort of our heroes being undone would be more acceptable if the enemy was completely different from the one in the OT. Another power arising as a threat would have been fine.(Spoiler alert) The point of the Prequels was to show how a war get's started and how power can be brought into the wrong hands by war. The Phantom Menace starts out with everything being fine and by ROTS everything goes downhill.Here everything goes downhill from a time where we are lead to think everything would be fine.If this was a different story I could accept this but it's not. I thought it was better than Attack of the Clones objectively. What get's me is they treated the movie like almost all ideas in the Prequels were terrible so don't have ideas. Don't try to expand the universe. (Sarcasm) It's not like Star Wars has endless potential or anything right? It's just the same thing over and over again.The Prequels made me expect too much I suppose. I mean we got Georges creative mind behind everything. We got PodRacing, Gungans (they're awesome forget about the overused character Jar Jar for a second), A giant war between what seems to be 2 disposable armies but it makes for some amazing footage, seeing what it means when Obi Wan told Luke your eyes can deceive you don't trust them with the saber fights, and the overall result ending with despair but a glimmer of hope.I felt like this film made the Original Trilogy look bad in making it completely irrelevant.Were there mistakes made with the prequels, well, yes but no one properly learned from them. Georges ideas with script doctoring and good execution that's how you do STAR WARS! That is how the Force works!I ""Hope"" Rouge One is stronger with it! They need a film to distract from this last one for a while."
ID_100074	10	The Force Awakens is the illustration of an emotional moment for me. Whenever I watch it I feel ... something. An emotion that is very personal, dark, sad, yet very happy. This film was the turning point from being the optimistic, emotional mute, happy yet dumb kid to the anxious, critical, emotional yet still optimistic teen. So much of my personal thoughts and feeling where forced onto this movie. So much memories of drawing Rey, Finn, and Kylo Ren from the trailers with my friends. So much memories of countless lunches just debating what the plot will be about and who the narrator was from the trailers is. It took over my life. Now at this moment in my life I was told to be more of a man. I had a strict rule with myself that no crying, no bad thoughts, no emotional things would be allowed in this body of mine. During my first midnight premiere, dressed up and pumped up. I cried for the first time I can ever remember. It all got released and it changed me. It's one of the most important moments in my 15 years of being alive. I also gained an interest in film that has never left me to this day. Oh and the film was amazing by the way.
ID_100075	6	Didnt watch these films for a long time, as the prequel trilogy was a bust...how could these be any good, and boy was I right.Theyre just taken star wars, and made it cheaper and dumber overall.The story itself isnt too bad, but the plot is so ridiculous, its hard not to laugh.How this band of essentially bumbling idiots manage to topple the new regime, by just basically bumbling around, its laughableWhereas the original trilogy showed the growth and depth required for the main characters to do what they did, here they just idiotically stumble around and things just succeed.And the entire force element has also been dumbed down. Gone is the mystique and depth, now everyone is a master of the force, now everyone is a master of light sabre combat...because why or how?Theres no explanation how these people got so good at what they do, they just magically 'got good'.Technically and visually its really good, but oh so stupid if you think about any of it for a mere second.
ID_100076	6	While it was good to see a new Star Wars movie on the big screen I strongly felt that despite some fun scenes overall it was not that memorable. To sum up my experience, Star Wars: The Force Awakens was nothing new. I feel conflicted here. Yes it was a good time filler. Yes it was good to see a new entry into the Star Wars franchise. But the movie just felt like it was going over old ground, and it's nothing that hasn't been done before.Star Wars: The Force Awakens takes place 30 years after the destruction of the second Death Star which occurred in Return of the Jedi (1983). Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), the last Jedi, has disappeared. The First Order led by Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) has risen from the fallen Galactic Empire and seeks to eliminate Luke and the Republic. The Resistance, backed by the Republic and led by Luke's twin sister, General Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher), opposes them while searching for Luke to enlist his aid.Resistance pilot Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) is captured and interrogated by Kylo Ren following an unsuccessful operation to capture Poe's droid BB-8 which is carrying vital information on the whereabouts of Luke Skywalker. A storm trooper who wants to leave his past behind named Finn (John Boyega) helps Poe escape and crash lands onto planet Jakku where he runs into BB-8 and Rey (Daisy Ridley), a resourceful scavenger. After escaping in the iconic Millennium Falcon following an air strike Rey, Finn and BB-8 encounter Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and Chewbacca where they embark on a quest to locate Luke Skywalker as well as evading Kylo Ren and the First Order.It was a trip down nostalgic lane catching up with Han Solo, Leia, Luke Skywalker, Chewbacca, R2-D2 and C-P30. The franchise receives a welcome injection of new blood with Rey, Finn, Poe, and Kylo Ren. Out of the new characters I liked Rey the most, and I hope to see her again in the franchise should there be a sequel. She's resourceful, adventurous, and appealing. I liked Finn but I must have missed why he grew tired of becoming a storm trooper. Kylo Ren was just another version of Darth Vader and Darth Maul but I thought his lightsaber looked more intimidating that the character itself.The plot was just like the same old path that has been taken before. It was good to see JJ Abrams take on the Star Wars franchise but I missed George Lucas' midas touch that he gave the previous Star Wars movies. John Williams returns as the composer and his musical score gave the movie an energetic feel.There was a large amount of hype surrounding the movie and rightfully so. Most people have raved about how good it was and there is a small minority that dislike the movie. I'm sitting firmly in the category of people who thought it was good but not great. While Star Wars The Force Awakens was worth a watch overall I felt as if it was rehashing old ground with a touch of nostalgia thrown in with the characters from the original movies. But nonetheless, Star Wars: The Force Awakens was a decent time filler.6/10.
ID_100077		Star Wars to me has always been about imagination.There's a lot that has been said about George Lucas in the last forty years, but there's one thing that can't be denied: he had imagination.JJ Abrams however does not and it shows in The Force Awakens. Besides the plot, which isn't original to say the least and has a lot of questionable elements, the visual design is very bland and derivative. The actual look and feel of the film reminds more of JJ's Star Trek films than of the original Star Wars trilogy, although luckily there are only a handful of lens flares to be seen.Even the music sounds uninspired. Which is a shame since the music was always one of the strongest parts of Star Wars.All in all it's an extremely average film, which would have been fine if it wasn't Star Wars. Star Wars is about pushing the limits and the only thing that was pushed here is your hype button.The prequel trilogy was a misstep in a lot of aspects, but at least George tried to innovate and create something new. The Force Awakens however is a big step backwards.
ID_100078	10	"I know I'm late to the Star Wars party, but there's an old say; better late than never. By now, many of us had seen what Abrams and Disney brought to us to the big screen, as it's currently breaking box office records left and right, and could possibly Avatar for highest grossing domestic film of all time in a matter of days now. It's been 10 years since the last Star Wars film, and boy, it couldn't had come out in a better time. Abrams and Disney bring us Episode 7: The Force Awakens. How good is it?The film takes place 30 years after the events of Return of Jedi. Darth Vader is defeated, and the galaxy is at peace. Until a new threat named Kylo Ren tries to take over the galaxy. He's after a map that could tell us where Luke Skywalker is. Luke has disappeared over the last 30 years and both the First Order and the Resistance and searching for him. The plot is very basic, but definitely does scream Star Wars. Abrams and his other writers did a good job with the plot for the 7th installment in the Star Wars saga, as it continues where we left off, and leaves us wanting more in the end. The plot introduces us to new heroes such as Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac), Finn (John Boyega), and Rey (Daisy Ridley).Now Abrams brought back some of the old characters we loved in the original Star Wars trilogy. Harrison Ford returns as Han Solo, Carrie Fisher returns as Leia, and even Chewbacca returns. Now they're introduced later on in the film, but Han and Chewie gets the most screen time. Now the new characters really carry this film. Poe is a Resistance pilot, Finn is a former Stormtrooper trying to change his ways, and Rey is a scavenger from the planet Jakku, who trades pieces of ships for reward. Of course, there's the little orange and white droid known as the BB-8 who plays as the trusty droid. The film focuses more on Rey and Finn the most as they team up with Han and Chewie in the second act of the film. They all serve the plot well, and the young good actors do a good job at portraying the heroes. Replacing Darth Vader is Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) who joined the Dark Side in a similar fashion as Darth Vader did. Adam Driver does a good job as playing the villainous Kylo Ren as he opposes as a threat to our new heroes in future movies.It's good to see Star Wars back on top. JJ Abrams brings the Star Wars saga back to life. We had to sit through George Lucas' prequel trilogy, but now we have a new trilogy we can enjoy and sit through. The hype was worth the wait, the old characters we all love are back, and the new characters are going to be loved by fans of this franchise. The story is good, and the visual effects are fantastic. It has everything we love about Star Wars, from the opening crawl to the classic John Williams score. I did have some nitpicks here and there. I did felt the second act did drove on for awhile, but that's mild criticism at best. Like Disney did with Marvel, Lucasfilms is in good hands as well, and I'll be looking forward to future Star Wars movies made by Disney. If you haven't check it out already, go check it out immediately. This is one expert if you don't want to miss on the big screen. This gets an easy 10/10 from me."
ID_100079	10	Star Wars Episode 7: The Force Awakens was absolutely incredible. The theater experience was the best movie watching experience I have ever endured. It's worth the hype and so much better than the prequels. In fact, it's my favorite Star Wars film. The cast and characters, old and new, are all phenomenal but Daisy Ridley (Rey) stole the show for me. I have fallen in love with Star Wars all over again. Thank you JJ Abrams for a story that will live on for generations to come. Wow! Bring on Episode VIII! The greatest Star Wars movie of all time and the most fun I've ever had in the theater. I just bought it on blu-ray and will enjoy this film for the remainder of my life. Just amazing.
ID_100080	10	I don't really understand the negative reviews on here. People moaned that the prequels were nothing like the original trilogy and now they are moaning that this is too similar??? LOL Get a life, children!This was an absolutely wonderful movie. Ever since I was 4 years old I've attended star wars openings. And the force awakens was no different. Was it like the old movies? No, of course not. But it was a new take on an ever expanding universe. Everyone on here throwing up 1 or 2 stars are just butthurt. They complain about Disney or JJ Abrams directing it. But the truth is they did a fantastic job revitalizing an old series. It's our jobs as fans to make it the best series possible, so please for the love of god ignore all of these idiots and see the movie. You will not be disappointed!
ID_100081	6	"A fun time at the theatre but not much else. I liked the additions, and how the Force worked, but it was kind of a mess. Weird pacing, hyperactive editing, and plot points straight out copied from A New Hope. Rey was okay, she was overacting at times and her performance felt a bit too artificial, in fact the whole movie felt artificial. The directing was just, too much! Too much intensity, overly polished and produced, out of place crooked camera angles and slow zooms to make everything intense when it's completely unnecessary. Good performances overall, fun action, I was eating my popcorn pretty fast. Well timed fan services and winks to the original trilogy, but when I left the theatre I told myself:""Meh, it was fine."" Better than the prequels obviously, but that is not saying much. They crammed so much in one movie, that the movie itself felt claustrophobic. Kids will LOVE it. I, personally, liked it for what it was, but I was disappointed considering the hype and fantastic reviews. NOT A BAD MOVIE, at all, it's a fairly competent big budget space movie, but not as good as I thought it would be. Haters giving this 1 star are just lying. It is far from a bad movie, there was a lot of love and craftsmanship behind this film and it would never deserve a one star.6.5/10 :-)"
ID_100082	10	This movie is amazing, entertaining, and well crafted as a film in general. The movie is incredibly exciting with humor, action, references and the beautifully written plot. There's so much more I could say about this film but I feel like you should watch it for yourself and enjoy it as much as I did. Ignore anyone who gives this a 1/10, there's not liking a film and then there's bitterness. 10/10 summed up the feeling I had before, during and after watching. It's an absolute masterpiece in every area across the board. End of story.
ID_100083	6	"Why did I entitled the review this way? Because if I was George Lucas... this is what I would've said at the premiere of this film. Sad...I am a fan since I was a kid. I used to sneak in the cinemas to see the first 2 episodes over and over again. We used to fight with sticks that in our minds were shiny lightsabers. We grew up and we loved every episode that came out... but this one... It's a disappointment for me.I will have to say that I admire the acting and all the technology that went into it, the cast and crew and that it really hurts me to give it such a rate.I'll spell it in bullet points why and I will do my best to avoid spoilers.So: 1. They timed the episode so they can sync it to the age of the old cast to they can bring them back. Nothing wrong in that. I even liked it. It was really good to see the iconic faces. But what they did to the characters... I'll let you judge.2. I could smell the plot from a mile. Why? Because it wasn't something to keep you guessing all the way.3. The movie was focus on making a huge hype to people break the box office, not on carrying the story and the legendary characters, telling a series of exciting tales.4. Lots of scenes were done just to bring back memories as they were almost cloned from the older episodes... seriously. Watch carefully and you tell me if I'm right.5. I tried to understand who's the main character in this one and honestly they did a great job in confusing me. I did figure it out, but the fog they spread over the story made it so hard to identify who I should follow and relate and even care about.6. The shaking of a particular character made me single him out way before the reveal and his implication into the story... which started pretty slow.7. A lot of the Star Wars characters are missing... and honestly... I was hoping to bring them back at least for some moments... even in a flashback.8. The lightsaber fights are not spectacular at all. It's almost like watching a Medieval show or some Comic Con fans having fulling around.9. Someone is using the lightsaber like (he/she) had 7 lives to learn all that. I remember the tough times Like and the others had to go through to master the weapon and the other Jedi abilities.10. Someone is becoming a Jedi just by thinking is one. Again... I don't want to push spoilers on you, but it's happening. I hope you catch the moment.11. There is another reveal in the film that is totally ordinary. They are trying to build the moment... but it's too short and way too slim because we don't know the story behind the character and we didn't see anything epic happening to it to come to the situation he is in at the moment.12. The ending... no comment. I don't want to say too much because I don't want to spoil it. Slow and way too ""epic"" for what it is. I was expecting something to finish the film to lead you into the other one... because you know that will start producing them on a conveyor belt once Disney put their hands on it.I'll stop here... there's a lot to talk about but I am sure a bunch of YouTUBErs jumped on it already.So... again. Disappointing. And I am disappointed that I am disappointed. Even worse.As I said: I bet George Lucas was saying ""No no no no no no..."" in his mind when he watched it."
ID_100084	5	So, to start, I'm not a big Star Wars movies fan. I like the Star Wars universe and like Star Wars: KOTOR games. I've watched all movies though.I was actually really excited because I believed that with a new Director and freedom from Disney to do whatever (changing the original story), they would make a great and interesting film, but...It begins with new characters and starts off real well. But after a while, it's just the same old non-interesting story, but this time with terrible antagonists (not going to spoil anything). It's almost like watching episode IV all over again but with recent effects and new characters. They forced it too much to be like episode IV, V and VI, and the result is something terrible.There are a few funny scenes or characters everyone talks about through internet memes, etc. but the movie in general is uninteresting and even tedious.
ID_100085		This moron JJ, managed to single-handedly screw up an entire franchise. I'm not going to theatres for any future Starwars flicks, because of him. I was hugely disappointed. It just didn't feel like a Star Wars movie... I really wonder how many episodes of lost this idiot truly worked on, probably just the pilot and that's it... Why he's such a big name in Hollywood is beyond me, absolutely terrible. The way this movie was hyped up, was just ridiculous... 2 billion box office... Highest grossed Star Wars film of all time... This... This lousy piece of crap of a film. You see people? This is how Hollywood works. They don't care about the fans or the story, it's all a money making scheme in this day and age in Hollywood.
ID_100086	10	"This new edition to the Star Wars franchise is arguably the best by  far. It combines the time-tested formula with the new and raw ideas  Disney brings to the table. From the moment the traditional text crawl  appears, this movie will keep you at the edge of your seat serving you  with action-packed scenes and unpredictable reveals that will surely  make you wanting for more.  One thing I particularly adored is how this new movie creativity uses  the Force. Disney has steered away from the boring 'push and pull'  concept and found ways you could never imagine the Force can be applied  and used on.  The presence of the old cast was monumental as it helped the old  audience transition to the new heroes  as they have similar (but also  diverse) qualities with their old counterparts. The ending, as  expected, is a major cliff-hanger. Expect to walk out of the cinema  dazed, amazed and confused as the movie, not only, answer the old  questions, but at the same time unfold new mysteries for the audience  to ponder on. Star Wars: The Force Awakens is a movie this generation  should really see. I genuinely recommend you see it on IMAX so you may  experience the Force in a way that will leave you lost in thought in  the days to come.  You-are-wel-come"
ID_100087	10	Let me just say that this film was sensational!To begin, the storyline is original and captivating. The acting from the newbies (Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, Oscar Isaac) is excellent. The acting from the old heroes was also incredible - Harrison Ford is back as Han Solo and Carrie Fisher is back as General Leia Organa, and they are better than ever! The villains are great too (Adam Driver as Kylo Ren) is great! The visuals - especially in IMAX 3D -- quite frankly blew my mind. Nothing looked overly fake like in the prequel trilogy - you really felt like you were part of the movie. The combination of practical and visual effects was brilliant! Another thing about this film, which you typically don't have in Star Wars films (especially the prequels) is humour - and The Force Awakens has plenty and it hits HARD!! And of course, the movie has many emotional moments, yes - I cried at some parts, and the pure nostalgia of it worked beautifully made it so much better! The final shot of the film was not just the best final shot of a Star Wars film - but one of (if not THE) best final shots of any film in cinematic history.Overall, Star Wars: The Force Awakens is more than I expected: it has the perfect blend of action, adventure, humour, some hints of romance, and emotion. By far the best film of 2015, the best Star Wars film, and one of the best movies of all time. Thank you JJ, we trusted you, and you delivered! Cannot wait for Episode 8!

First, the creators as much as possible embodied in it a visual image from old movies. Secondly, there were many actors and favorite characters from the old ""Star Wars"". Thirdly, the film has comical moments that fans of this space saga will certainly appreciate. Well, of course, a lot of shooting both on land and in space. In general, the continuation was possible, as an integral part of previous films. The film is quite dynamic and spectacular. I can not call it the best if compared with the rest of the ""Star Wars"", it can't be called the best.I was pleased with the schedule, and humor added its zest. The only thing that can be attributed to the shortcomings of the film is the absence of a pronounced story line. Of course, the plot is there, but it's some kind of blurry. I recommend watching this movie, but do not expect anything supernatural from him."
ID_100089	6	Star Wars: The Force AwakensDespite its liberation years ago, the Galaxy is once more under the control of a new Sith Lord: Darth Disney.And while the Dark Mouse doesn't make an appearance in this sci-fi movie, his presence is felt.A forager, Rey (Daisy Ridley), befriends a droid transporting the whereabouts of the last Jedi (Mark Hamill) to the resistance General (Carrie Fisher). But an overzealous member of The First Order (Adam Driver) wants the droid too, so Rey must flee with help from an ex-stormtrooper (John Boyega). Later, they align themselves with a grizzled smuggler (Harrison Ford) with knowledge of Rey's newfound abilities.With stunning effects and organic worlds, Disney's continuation returns the franchise back to basics. Unfortunately, that also includes familiar menaces, similar plot points and a plagiaristic ending. Not to mention a petulant child posturing as the villain. Furthermore, where does Disney get off not including any sing-along kids songs? Yellow Lightvidiotreviews.blogspot.ca
ID_100090	10	I saw Star Wars in 1977 and since then I have seen all the episodes multiple times. The Force Awakens is one of the best entries in the series if not the best one yet. I do not understand any negative reviews, especially by the so-called original fans. This movie is awesome and outstanding. Kylo Ren is the best Star Wars villain yet. The young actors are by far better than Hamill, Ford and Fisher were in 1977. Especially Daisy Ridley, who does a very good and convincing job. By the way, the movie is meant to entertain and that is what it does to PERFECTION. 10/10 with ease!
