ID_100031	"This movie hits every conceivable emotion, but above all, it's fun. Nowadays, we have so much dark gritty stuff which is great and deep, but it gets tiring. And, things that try to be fun come off as overly silly and dumbed down. The Force Awakens does something not many films have done successfully in a while; combine the two seamlessly into one balanced package. The prequels tried to do this, and it blew up in Lucas' face. The reason it works in this movie is that all the humour and drama comes naturally from the characters. Yes, the plot and beats are VERY similar to A New Hope, but that was a great movie. If it ain't broke, don't fix it. Besides, that's exactly what's been missing from movies lately. So don't listen to all these negative reviewers saying ""it's a remake"", or a ""rip-off"". Towards the end, it goes completely its own way becoming more like The Empire Strikes Back.Let's start with the characters. It's great to see the old characters back in action. The Han and Leia scenes could have easily felt like they were just in there for nostalgia factor, but they feel natural and factor into the plot. Given the vast number of characters, it's amazing how very few of them feel shoe-horned in. There are three that I can think of who did, but all three of them are confirmed to be in the next one, so I'll get my fix then. However, the real standouts are the new characters. Adam Driver brings unexpected depth to Kylo Ren. Oscar Isaac is intensely likable as Poe Dameron. John Boyega is great as Finn. But the best is Daisy Ridley as Rey. She is going to be in so much more stuff, I guarantee. The chemistry between her and Finn was one of my favourite parts of the movie.The cinematography is incredible. The camera never moved around in the originals. Here, it follows around the action, capturing the feeling of playing with toys as a kid more perfectly than any movie before. It also just feels so much like Star Wars. Every sound and image is familiar. The movie has a real presence; the practical effects make it feel real. John Williams' new score is great, of course. He does a great job integrating the old with the new. In fact, that would be my summary of the movie. It pays enough homage to the original while setting up an exciting new story. I like how not everything is revealed by the end of this film. The final shot perfectly sums up all the questions we are left with and foreshadows what to come. It may be one of my favourite final shots of a movie ever.In conclusion, some people are going to hate on it for being too much like the originals, others are going to complain that it's not enough like them. Some will say too many questions were answered, others will say that not enough were. In the end, there are so many expectations riding on this film that it will never live up to everyone's hype. It's a minor miracle what JJ did. He had to bring in all of the old, set up a sprawling galaxy of new, establish what's been going on for 30 years between films, add humour, add drama, and somehow make it cohesive and fun. If you go in with the understanding that this is a movie, not the second coming, you will leave immensely satisfied."
ID_100032	I know biased fanboys of the painfully average, outdated original trilogy will cluelessly cry about this, but yes, The Force Awakens is the most well made film of the Star Wars saga. This film has all the goodness of the original movies, characters who are easily likable, incredible effects, John Williams' rousing musical score and a great time at the cinema, enjoyable with our families and friends. But there are things which are even better than the original movies. Interaction between the lead characters is so natural, you got to commend the writers and the director J J Abrams for their amazing work. Most blockbuster films today tend to focus on spectacle and visual effects enhanced action over tender human moments. This film balances action and human drama amazingly well. The new characters are extremely memorable, the new actors Daisy Ridley and John Boyega are wonderful in their roles, along with Oscar Isaac. BB8 is extremely adorable, dare I say even better than R2D2. Adam Driver as Kylo Ren is a worthy villain, with the best motion capture actor in the world Andy Serkis, doing what he does best, as Supreme Leader Snoke. The visual effects on display here are incredible, and unlike the prequels which were ruined by their CGish feel, this one relies on practical effects. Almost everything in this film looks real, the stormtroopers look real, because they are real mean in armor, kudos for J J Abrams for not using CGI even for closeup shots of troopers. J J Abrams is a better director than George Lucas, and that will be very clear when you see the film. This film deserves every award and acclaim it received. A film as widely anticipated and hyped as this can rarely ever be this good, and yet........it is!
ID_100033	The moment they announced JJ Abhrams would direct the new Star Wars I feared the worst and my fears have come true. JJ Abhrams has done to Star Wars what he did to Stat Trek,make it a commercial success and nothing else. Star Wars is supposed to be more than commercial success...it's supposed to be more than special effects....it's supposed to be more than cheesy one liners which to be honest is not even funny.....it's supposed to be something that stays with you for a long long time,that's what episode 4 did to all its viewers. 15 minutes into the movie and we are introduced to the two new additions to the Star Wars universe who are going to take this franchise forward.But I'm sad to say for the 2 hours that followed you don't feel for either one of them.Imagine saying that to Han,Liea and Luke in episode 4!!! There is nothing wrong with the casting,it's the story that lets them done.They are just thrown at your face. The movie also suffers from major plot holes. They could have done anything with episode 7 but they ended up doing what all Star Wars fans feared just another film.
ID_100034	We waited for years, and it's finally here. At 3 o'clock this morning I entered the cinema wide-eyed, full of hope. As was with many people's childhoods, Star Wars was a staple of mine, and to this day the original trilogy still stand as some of my favourite films. J.J. Abrams famously managed to reignite the Star Trek franchise with two fantastic films, so when tasked with doing similar to Star Wars, some people were sceptical, but nonetheless excited. The main questions is: did he deliver? Yes he damn well did!You know that tight throat feeling you get when you have a sudden urge of adrenaline, for the last hour of the film, I had that feeling, sitting there on the edge of my seat, heart pounding fast. What I was watching was exhilarating to say the least.Let's look more at the film (don't worry, there will be no spoilers featured). First off, the opening - the classic text followed by the panning shot to a planet (or death star) with a Star Destroyer emerging into the frame, it all features, as does the use of practical effects and puppets / robots over the extensive use of CGI that was utilised in the prequel trilogy, thus giving fans the old school style of Star Wars they wanted oh so much. The film is fast-paced, with stunning action scenes and spectacles, but not rushed, the shots linger and the camera moves gracefully, giving us a spectacular view of the situation at hand.The prequel trilogy shunted the franchise on a downward spiral, the overuse of CGI and the introduction of some of the most annoying characters in film (a-hem Jar Jar Binks), but Abrams, the finest choice of a director to reignite the franchise, did nothing more than show pure love for the films and has created a sequel that definitely exceeded my expectations. A film that features endless nostalgia with appearances from Ford (who is beyond fantastic), Fisher, Hamill even Peter Mayhew as Chewbacca and constant references to the original trilogy.The only partial negative aspect is its somewhat lack of originality, it acts more as an homage to 'A New Hope' than an original tale. But if you overthink points like this when viewing it, you won't enjoy it, so just empty your head of that and watch the film for what it is: a space opera that acts as nothing more than a sheer piece of movie magic!
ID_100035	This movie is amazing, entertaining, and well crafted as a film in generalThe film is incredibly exciting with humor, action, references and a beautifully written plot. This movie will blow you away, as both a Star Wars fan and a movie fan. If you actually like Star Wars you will love this film, end of story.It is safe to say that J.J Abrams has fulfilled his mission in bringing back Star Wars to its former glory! Cannot wait for Episode 9!Rating: 10 out of 10
ID_100036	I simply cannot comprehend how anyone would give this a bad review. It was, without a doubt brilliant. The directing was amazing, to the point where you're so immersed in the scenes, I actually felt giddy during some of the flight scenes, it feels like you're actually IN the ship. The special effects are tastefully done, and are a perfect follow on from its predecessors. Nostalgia rules in this thrilling film, we felt like applauding several times throughout, and got goosebumps in some amazing scenes. It was also surprisingly humorous, (in appropriate amounts), and the balance of new characters versus returning characters and story lines was brilliant. 10 out of 10 for me!
ID_100037	"J.J Abrams has without a doubt constructed and delivered the best Star Wars film since Return of the Jedi. Better yet, the best Star Wars film after Empire. Evidence of this is by the wonderful cast of familiar and new characters, particular stand outs are Adam Driver and Daisy Ridley. The action was great, the story worked wonders. J.J added his genius, unique touch. As he did with Star Trek 2009 + Into Darkness.It did a wonderful job bridging the gap to a new story. Practical effects were 10/10. The older fans are just butthurt that more people are exposed to a new generation of incredible/better movies. TFA is simply perfection, as much as those laughable online trolls don't want you to believe ; )"
ID_100038	I'll be honest, in the months leading up to the release of JJ Abrams sequel I was growing increasingly skeptical about his ability to do the film justice. But after finally seeing it, I was SERIOUSLY impressed! Abrams is clearly a loyal, highly intelligent fan of the saga, and has done all Star Wars fans a great service. The pacing and flow of the film is a mixture of the original and prequel trilogy, and left me almost wishing Abrams had taken the reigns for the prequels as well. It is amazingly written and directed with stunning visuals and cinematography.The action is fast paced and flawless (the space battle scenes and light saber duels especially) and the story woven with emotion and the best occasional gags and one liners to date. I particularly enjoyed the character of Kylo Ren and was left begging for more backstory and information on this confused and helpless villain People certainly loved to point out downfalls in George Lucas' prequels, but it's factually obvious Abrams has completely delivered on all fronts in doing the saga justice! 10/10
ID_100039	I was lucky enough to see The Force Awakens on its release day and I'm glad to say that it was spectacular! The movie was well directed and a genuine Star Wars feel was evident throughout.Throughout the whole 2 and a half hour running time, I was treated to a masterpiece of visual effects as well as well as a compelling and convincing story which introduced the two new lead characters: Rey and Finn. I thought BB-8 was a humorous, cute character and can't wait to see more of him in the upcoming films. JJ Abrams did an amazing job creating easily the best film of the year.Out of all the Star Wars films, this is definitely the second best in the franchise (just BARELY behind The Empire Strikes Back)
ID_100040	"Context: I grew up on these films. I didn't think the first trilogy was the ""best thing ever made,"" but the story was gripping, the material was fresh, and I couldn't get enough of it. Hell, I can still remember playing the pod racer game on N64 after episode 1 came out and every time I would race, would relive the stories in my mind.It has become abundantly clear after sitting through this cash-cow that one can ascertain from fairly obvious decision-making for this film the following notions:1) There was NO intention of contributing to an amazing story. Instead the saga ripped-off general focal points from the previous films... Just to name a few: a larger Death Star, the same weapon/laser-beam on this larger Death Star, the only weakness of said giant Death Star, the only villain wearing a Vader-like mask.2) Success of the film largely will be based on (A) appealing to small children who cannot look away from bright shiny light and CGI effects, (B) loyal fans of the first trilogy who managed to hang in there for the 2nd trilogy (somewhat of a train-wreck) through introducing original cast-mates strategically over a 2-hour period forcing us to sit tight to the end.They made things even more apparent by recreated Chalmun's Spaceport Cantina on Tatooine. Throughout the entire film, I simply could not stop thinking that I was being tricked into paying just because they took advantage of my appreciation for the earlier movies.3) I briefly mentioned this, but it bears repeating: THE STORY WAS AWFUL!!! Little more could have been done to show how J.J. Abrams felt about this one... Sure, I'll credit him with a great rendition of Star Trek, but in Ep-7 I found it extremely difficult not to feel like during the development phase, he would often write a bit and then get bored with it whereby taking a huge bowel movement on that particular piece and proceeding on to the next scene.For example, when Han Solo finally reunited with Leia (aka Princess Leia) after 30 years... boy oh boy was that one of the most poorly designed representations of long-lost love between two people: upon seeing one another they put on a sad face whereby Chewbacca walks by and pats her on the back in such a casual way as if to say ""Whats up Laya.""This one gets two stars!I cannot help but feel some attachment to seeing Harrison Ford, Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher in their original roles just one last time.Ultimately, what made this entire experience a failure, was how the following two items were depicted: (1)The Force, (2)the Lightsabre.(1)THE FORCE: The fabric which lines this fantastically designed mythical world which has so much history. The Force was offered up as little more than a ""trick"" which may be learned with little training or dedication to having a greater understanding. Remember how long Luke spent trying to uncover all the different ways which the force encapsulates his world? He would duel blindfolded with a drone, gain incites into future events, connect with his sister through feeling the force, fetching the lightsaber out of snow while tied up in a cave about to be eaten by a yeti... you get the idea. Yet Rey spends about 2 minutes repeating a few words to a guard, thereby forcing him to release her, having completely harnessed something Luke doesn't manage for a greater portion of his time as a Jedi, well past the point where his training is announced as complete by Yoda. It felt as if the writers simply were instructed to skip addressing this aspect of Rey because it would take away from all the cheap, effortless ways by which to garner more paying viewers. (2)LIGHTSABER: How many different people were going to casually whip out Luke's lightsaber during tight situations? It was ridiculous how often this would occur...But I digress... I shan't keep you away any longer... If you're a small child or never cared for any of the originals, then this film is for you. But for everyone else out there who grew up on the first trilogy, it has been despicable to see how these people have taken advantage of such an amazing story in exchange for ticket sales... Having said all that, I am beginning to question the ratings. At one point this site was the most reliable source for film reviews (Rotten Tomatoes always seemed to be the biased place), however after seeing the overall rating and many of the initial reviews (of which I AM CERTAIN the consensus for this film is not in the 80% range), this site is losing the usefulness it once had.And a ""Top 250"", no less? Yea right... The review system is losing its validity. Now I notice a pattern immediately after release whereby numerous fake accounts are created which then give raving 10-star reviews. It's so clear what is happening there, but IMDb seems not to have a solution nor want to fix the problem.----- 2/10 STARS -------- Review by Searsino -----"
ID_100041	"Aside from the Classic Star Wars aesthetic that was very well incorporated in this new installment, there is really not much else to look forward to.Most scenes felt like a repetition of the previous, with an exception to changes in atmosphere. Other than that, the same three- part pattern was there: Characters verbally narrate the ""Why's"" and ""How's"" of the story, nostalgic references or characters are thrown in to help the audience feel as if the story is more intricate or clever than it truly is. Finally, the characters find a way to transport themselves to another planet or place, and the pattern repeats itself over again.In a way, the entire thing felt like an experimental development of the Star Wars Universe. There are numerous settings with a diverse range of characters, but the writing is bland, and most of the acting, except from Rey and Fin is mediocre at most. Numerous wide shots expound on well-thought out atmospheres, but this in no way justifies the lack of narrative depth."
ID_100042	"So, my opinion of this movie is that it is the ""greatest movie of all time."" WHY? Let us get started. Number One: This movie is the first one to be in Sphero's ""Watch with me"" features with its BB-8. If you have a BB-8 from Sphero, you get what I mean if you have iPhone 5s or later. Number Two: The music by John Williams is FANTASTIC! I am so mad at the Academy that it did not give John Williams and Oscar for his music!!!!! This movie is his 50th Oscar nomination! WHY THE HELL DID THEY NOT GIVE HIM AN Oscar!?!?!?!??!?!Number Three: The old characters finally return. Bad news, is that George Lucas is not there to help make it, so that is a bit a problem that does not matter. Number Four: This movie is similar to Star Wars: A New Hope.Number Five: Daisy Ridley's performance as Rey is GREAT! Even though she is not my favorite person, she really got her talent through and she made the production quicker. I agree with some people that she is fun to watch.Those are the five main reasons why this movie is the greatest movie of all time. May the force be with The Force Awakens."
ID_100043	I have grown up with Star Wars. I was nine when I went to the original. Empire Strikes Back is my favourite film of all time and I don't care what the basement detractors say, I liked the prequels and they get an undeserved bad rap. They're movies, they're entertaining, get over it. The Force Awakens has everything you want in a Star Wars movie. The acting was good, as was the action and special effects. If you're a fan you owe it to yourself to go see it. If you're a hater you probably still will and then spend the rest of your time on the net complaining how George Lucas raped your childhood and JJ is a hack. Don't listen to the pathetic haters, go see it for yourself. You won't be disappointed!10/10
ID_100044	"With this absolute epic, Star Wars.....is......back! JJ Abrams achieved a small miracle in creating a movie that respects its original material, brings in a ton of new characters, makes it appealing for new viewers and sets up a story to build a new Star Wars trilogy on. Without giving away too many spoilers, the story revolves around a scavenger (Rey), a renegade stormtrooper(Finn) and a fighter pilot(Poe) in their quest to defeat an enemy with the power to endanger the galaxy. To be honest, actual great acting has never been a strong point in any of the previous Star Wars movies. This trend has thankfully been broken, as the stellar cast give great performances throughout the whole movie. The newcomers Daisy Ridley and John Boyega, playing as Rey and Finn respectively, prove themselves more than capable of carrying the load in continuing the saga. They both show great chemistry together and give us extremely likable characters, with Rey bringing the heart of the film and Finn the abundant energy. Oscar Isaacs, who plays Poe, is the veteran among the young cast and pulls of a cool and smart-ass X-wing pilot. And finally, the old cast returns to give this film a true Star Wars feel to it. Harrison Ford returns as Han Solo and has not seemed to skip a beat since 1983, as he is as cheeky and bad-ass as ever. His witty banter with Chewbacca is a pleasure to watch, but Ford also brings a strong emotional performance this time too. Carrie Fisher as Leia also returns, in a rather small role, and delivers some sweet scenes with Han and the new cast. However, the most complex character with the best arc in this movie, is the antagonist Kylo Ren. Ren, played by Adam Driver, gives us an extremely intimidating villain with a troubled past we are eager to discover. Ultimately, he serves us more than a Darth Vader wannabe. JJ Abrams alongside Lawrence Kasdan wrote a fun and entertaining screenplay with plenty of emotional plot twists and content. Each main character has its own background and motivation, which develops over the duration of the film. A pleasant surprise to see is the humor used in the movie. The comedic relief in the film was used very effectively in developing chemistry and sympathy for the characters. It is also a sign that the movie does not take itself too seriously as the prequels did. The Force Awakens is filled with exhilarating action and moves with great pace during these scenes. Yet, Abrams knows to slow it down during scenes conveying intense emotion giving the audience time to process all that is thrown at them. These combined make it easy to understand the main characters' motivations, making the emotional investment so much better. As is typical of Star Wars, the movie is full of awe inspiring visual images and astonishing sound editing, creating new sounds for laser beams, light sabers, and alien noises. The cinematography is equally impressive, showing beautiful landscape shots of new planets reminiscent of the original trilogy. The cinematographer also shows us a diverse array of shots, giving heart- pounding POV shots inside the cockpit and nice long shots of the battlefield giving it a great scope while avoiding confusion caused by the numerous explosions. John Williams makes a welcome return to the Star Wars franchise with a bombastic new score, but also with nicely timed inserts of his famous original music to bring up emotional heartwarming feeling among the old-school fans. In conclusion, The Force Awakens is a return to greatness for the Star Wars franchise. This beautiful reunion of old characters combined with the introduction of promising new characters results in an emotional, adventure trip that left me excited for what is coming next. To quote Jimmy Kimmel, this movie was probably ""the most anticipated sequel since the New Testament"". So expect this movie to be under the most intense scrutiny by reviewers as they dissect the movie to its core to find the tiniest (I.E. laughably non-existent) flaws. In the end, The Force Awakens delivers as a fantastic Star Wars film and an incredibly worthy addition to the franchise."
ID_100045	Episode 7 has redeemed a franchise that, for many traditional fans, had become a niggling source of disappointment.This is everything that 1, 2 & 3 weren't. The acting is solid - something we've never really associated with the franchise. The music is not clichéd - there are some new themes which will most likely catch on. The storyline is coherent and promises longevity and the action is gripping. From the opening scene you realise that 32 years after Return of the Jedi and the utter disappointment of 1, 2 & 3, Star Wars fans are finally in for a incredible treat!It is a return to what worked. The directing is solid as is the dialogue. In fact, it's the best dialogue in all eight films. 5*
ID_100046	I don't need to pathetically hyper analyze it to love it. It was brilliant from start to finish. Unlike the godawful Lord of the Rings films, which are completely unwatchable. I really loved the movie, can't wait to watch it again. I wasn't sure what JJ Abrams would do with the film but he has been unbelievably great for the franchise. It gets really emotional at times and is just an absolute pleasure to watch. It felt like it was 1980 again. It's great to see this franchise resurrected and it was a beautifully natural continuation that delivered in spades! #TYJJ
ID_100047	"Before I start writing this review, I want to say I'm a huge fan of George Lucas' Universe. I have the 6 previous movies on Blu-Ray, which I love very much. I also played the games, watched Star Wars the Clone Wars film and TV show as well as reading the books.So I was eager to see this brand new episode of the main saga. The first without George Lucas in command. I heard good things about JJ Abrams and how he turned all he touched in gold so I was expecting a lot. At the end I am quite disappointed.It would be wrong to say everything is bad in this movie. It's still entertaining and enjoyable to watch. But I expected so much more of it. It's not any kind of saga we are talking here. It's a classic one which enchanted so many fans throughout the world for several decades. This is Star Wars and it should be something which will stay in memories whatever happens. And about that, it fails big times as it levels down with the average blockbusters of the genre. It has lost its magic. It's so saddening really and truly something I would have never foreseen. Even the Emperor wouldn't have.The only appealing side of 'The Force Awakens' and the only thing that seems to work almost correctly was the come back of the original cast. I wont lie, it's great to see Harrison Ford, Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher back. When Han Solo and Chewbacca appear for the first time and listening Ford saying ""Chewie we're home"", I had a shiver. It was maybe the only time it did or was it another one when we see Leia and Han seeing each other for the first time.The rest of the cast is not bad but because of the lack of vision haunting this movie until the end, the characters are quite shallow. They have potential but you really need to dig much deeper to allow them expressing it completely. The only new face I really appreciated was BB8 the new droid. He is not as brave as R2D2 but his mimics melted me. He's really cute and sympathetic.Now lets talk about the mishaps. JJ Abrams missed his target. We never wished to see a copy & paste of the Original trilogy even if it's much bigger and stronger. What I was expecting was a movie which would be as visionary as the original story. So at the end I would have the feeling that despite all I've seen about Star Wars, it will still keep surprising me by bringing something new.Instead we have a fast-forwarded and very poorly written version of A New Hope and Return of The Jedi. The new characters are just the 2016 alter egos of the 1977 ones. There is absolutely not a single drop of originality throughout the movie. We have no difficulty to understand that Rey is related to Luke because like him she is stranded in a desert planet, trying to make a living by scavenging ships. Finn is just the black version of Han Solo. He wants to get out of the grip of the First Order aka The Galactic Empire or what's left of it, just like Han Solo wanted to escape from Jabba the Hutt. BB8 is R2D2, the only hope for the Resistance aka the Rebel Alliance, to save themselves from the Order. Kylo Ren is Anakin/Darth Vader who betrayed Luke as his grand father betrayed Obi Wan in a very identical way. And Han Solo is taking the role of Obi Wan as the iconic member getting killed by the bad guy. Like I said a copy & paste!So yes JJ Abrams definitely missed what makes the Star Wars Saga essence: the story. The Force Awakens hasn't any story. It has no vision. It may work for a movie like Transformers but you do that with Star Wars and you're digging your grave. As JJ Abrams used most of the material provided by the first trilogy, should I expect that he will pillage the Prequel trilogy for Episode 8? I would suggest JJ to use George Lucas for the next episode scriptwriting but as they are already producing Episode 8 while the Force Awakens is still available on theaters, I think we will enjoy another epic failure. George, Come Back!"
ID_100048	I mean honestly, what do these whiny nerds want? Prior to episode 7, I distinctly remember die-hard fans complaining how the prequels were pure garbage. Now you're all saying you miss the prequels? XD XD XDThis movie was great! I'm seriously baffled by some of these reviews. I'm sure if this series is ever rebooted, or another entry releases in 20+ years, you'll all yearn for JJ's Star Wars. You people have no idea what you want and will just complain no matter what is put forth. Cut the crap.I thought this movie was great. The new characters, Finn and Rey, were instantly likable, and the inclusion of old favorites felt natural. I highly recommend this film and I think most NORMAL people will enjoy it.
ID_100049	Before watching The Force Awakens, I was slightly skeptical. However, I can safely say I am now a HUGE fan of the Star Wars universe!The Force Awakens stands as a rock-solid foundation of a promising trilogy, which will easily surpass the original trilogy if this incredibly high standard of film making is carried forward.Clearly J.J. Abrams enjoyed every minute of work when directing this movie, and he expresses his love for the Star Wars franchise extremely well by respecting the original material and cleverly linking the trilogies and simultaneously building new, strong characters who rival even the classics such as Han or Luke. Overall, I would say that TFA is a must-see movie, not only for fans of the Star Wars franchise, but for anyone who has access to a television screen. J.J Abrams does an absolutely masterful job at showing his love and passion for Star Wars, and the finished products (Yay Episode 9!!!!) will all go down in history as some of the greatest films of any trilogy in history.
ID_100050	"I love Star Wars, especially the original stuff, of course. The Force Awakens stays true to the original trilogy; with the start of the film on a Tatooine-like planet, Jakku, as per usual. It follows the thrilling journey of the brilliant Poe of the Resistance and Finn of past Storm trooper relation, at first, as you are thrown into the blistering excitement. But then there is a twist in the main hero being a girl. It works both simply for a change, but also in that it is pretty much a first in as big a film as Star Wars that the main character is a female. That wouldn't matter, though, if the character wasn't a likable hero, or if the acting wasn't any good. Fortunately, those boxes are ticked, as with every character in the film bar Snoke, who is an example of bad CGI, unfortunately. He doesn't play a very big part, though, and other than him the special effects are fantastic — with the use of more practical effects being a refreshing move from Lucasarts, and one that the film benefits from, as it doesn't look artificial like so many films do nowadays (The Hobbit, Star Wars prequels, Avengers, etc).Along with the great use of practical effects, there are fantastically designed costumes all over the joint, with great designs ranging from the new-look storm troopers to Kylo Ren and his super cool outfit.Going back to character, though, the move from Disney to advertise Finn as the main Jedi was clever, as it meant for the reveal of Rey as the Jedi to be much better than otherwise could have been possible. Finn, though, is a fantastic character, with John Boyega deserving more nominations than he's received for his charismatic performance. One other thing done well with The Force Awakens is the lack of slow story development which so marred the progress of the prequel films, and A New Hope, and also the decision to focus on characters to develop the story other than excess plot development means for better character development and means you actually like the characters, unlike Episodes I, II and III. Moreover, the return of light-heartedness and inclusion of comedy makes it an even more enjoyable watch; however, mixed with darker themes clearly inspired by the best parts of Episode III, there is more violence and concentration on action — with that providing excitement, and the comedy bringing extra enjoyment. Finn personifies the more light- hearted approach along with the brilliant BB8, and Kylo Ren is a fantastic vehicle for the darker side of the film, who I love – even though some people might think he's a bit of a snotty nosed dork. Kylo Ren is probably just as good a villain as Darth Maul in my opinion at least, but he's used much, much better, fortunately. Ah, yes. The Phantom Menace. Let's all remind ourselves of that excellent part of film history. Good for you and me, though, we can forget about that now, because we have the sequel trilogy, which could even be better than the original if they keep on getting things right like they did with this film.One more thing I'm grateful was done right was the score. A mixture of both classic tracks and new ones, it's fantastic in both providing towards all the drama and the overall feel of the film. Because, by using both old tracks and new ones it reminds you of the past (sparking your nostalgia) whilst also bringing something new, which the film does fantastically with every aspect; from the story to the cast to the sets to the action and to the (you guessed it) score. Other than being a tad ridiculous in some plot turns, and lacking quite the same grandness of scale in sets and cast that the original films did – but only just, mind you; it's pretty much perfect in what it has set out to do; providing excitement, enjoyment, drama, action and nostalgia in abundance. Enough for a boy like me to squeal.Verdict:The Force Awakens is the main product of Disney's buy out, and so I'm very happy Disney got involved if it meant this beast of a film was made. It was almost a dream of mine that there would be a sequel trilogy, and it has actually happened, so I was aptly excited. My excitement was repaid emphatically, as when I sat in the cinema fulfilling one of my most anticipated pipe dreams, I was blown away by this surprisingly light-hearted yet violent, action packed and particularly well crafted, yes, beast of a film.So I give it: 94/100."
ID_100051	When it comes to this, it seems that there really isn't much of substance to this movie. Various things happen, a lot of commotion on the screen, but where do they ultimately lead? What is the bigger picture? Truth is that there isn't even a bigger picture. What we see, is all that is and it is nothing particularly exciting even if they try to mask the hollowness behind a bunch of explosions, shootings and other stuff. To be honest, I see no difference between this Star Wars movie or any average Michael Bay movie. Plot wise it's about as deep as Transformers. We have got Harisson Fordie back and Carrie Fisher and that weird blonde dude. Carrie used to be smoking in the 80's. I mean, she does look a bit like a farmer from 19th century, but in that slave outfit, even if the movie was bland as hell, I could still enjoy the sight of her cleavage. But now she's 60 and that sight isn't particularly attractive to me anymore. And Ford? He used to be such a man in the 80's. But now he's just an old man, who looks like he should be at a retirement home watching TV with other old people. And the blonde dude is just as annoying as he was. He ain't a Jedi. Just a farm boy. This movie really lacks in every department imaginable. How you suppose for me to enjoy a piece like this when there's nothing beyond the sparkling facade? Where's the emotion? Where's the depth? In my opinion Star Wars has to be one of the worst franchises imaginable and I will never associate myself with any person that belongs to it's fan base.
ID_100052	"Star Wars: The Force Awakens. A new story about old stories. The obvious thing is that the new film of the new trilogy looks very nice, even when compared with the films of the 2000s, and especially when compared with the original trilogy. But, the story itself very strongly in some places begins to resemble the ""New Hope"". There are Darth Vader, Luke Skywalker and others in this film, but in a more different form, which is why history begins to repeat itself accordingly. But even with these moments, you want to watch the new Star Wars, because it's all just as beautiful and interesting. New characters have entered this huge universe well and I hope they will take root well in it."
ID_100053	1977 was a big year in the cinema. Star Wars (later titled Episode IV-A New Hope) came out. It was a big year for me as well. I went to see my first James Bond film in the cinema. Star Wars I saw some years later on television, which as my brother said 20 minutes in. It is just some characters walking in the desert.JJ Abrams who ran out of ideas by the time he went on to direct Star Trek: Into Darkness has not waited long to reuse old ideas for Star Wars 7. Just as Creed carries on the Rocky saga by going back to Rocky 1 & 2, Abrams with Lawrence Kasdan & Michael Arndt has gone back to A New Hope to set up this new trilogy.We are back to the world of Star Wars and with advances in technology, special effects, CGI and animatronics we have not advanced much in visuals from the original trilogy which is over 30 years old from The Return of the Jedi. The visuals are uninspired and rather lazy.We have a Tattooine like planet where a young woman, Rey meets a droid carrying important information regarding Luke Skywalker. Rey comes across Finn a storm-trooper who has had a reawakening of his own and met a rebel fighter to escape.Rey seems to be feeling the force and in a series of coincidences or I guess the power of the force escapes her pursuers in a wreck which turns out to be the Millennium Falcon and later comes across Han Solo and Chewbacca.That is not all the Darth Vader like baddie is the grandson of Darth Vader, the son of Han and Princess Leia who has gone over to the dark side but still conflicted with the power of good. Their will be a father and son reunion and you can all guess how this will turn out as the scene is reminiscent of when Obi Wan encountered Darth Vader.It is entertaining, they put on all the right beats with action scenes coming at the right time and some humour, star cameos such as Daniel Craig voicing a storm-trooper or an actress, Harriet Walter who is the niece of Christopher Lee. It is just the story has been recycled and you think that after 30 years, this is the best they could do?If Lucas wanted a new trilogy he might has well remastered and re- edited his original trilogy because I know where this is heading.
ID_100054	Well, what can I say. First, let me state I'm 42 years old and a massive Star Wars fan. And if there's one reason why this movie is so fantastic, it's that I saw the same wonder and magic in my daughter's eyes that I had when I was a young boy.They did it! They finally managed to bring the Star Wars universe to life. All the bad things from the prequels are gone, all the good parts from the originals are back. It's exciting, funny, spectacular, emotional and everything a Star Wars movie should be. What an achievement from the entire team of director, producers, cast and designers. So many things to love about this. I had been waiting for this for SO long, and god I'm so happy it lived up to my hopes for it.Can't wait to see what's coming!
ID_100055	And I thought Jar Jar Binks was the pits for this movie series. Jeeez, was I wrong.They have now managed to turn this into a politically correct, both when it comes to sex and race, boring and totally non-entertaining pile of horse manure, that not even the most hard-core Star Wars fan could possibly like.And Harrison Ford? Oh man.. why oh why? BB-8 was probably the only one in the whole show that managed the upgrade from the past till the present, with any kind of dignity.Please. Please. Stop doing this. Make movies for adults with a brain, instead of for 12-year olds with Alzheimer.
ID_100056	Lousy movie, stupid, shallow, even more childish than ever. Same sh@t, different outdated gimmicks piled on an ancient concept that never evolved to graduate from a child care center.The young black actor, John Boyega, is a terrible cast and a very bad actor, looks stupid and very unlikable. Since Obama, Hollywood and TV industries had stupidly jumped on the Politically Correct Wagon, putting many unnecessary and inappropriate black actors as leading roles. This young guy's face looked just retarded and moronically pathetic! His acting in this film had undoubtedly further jeopardized this already childish film even more painful to watch.Another politically correct must-have role was the white female leading role to match up the black role for the inter-racial relationship and/or romance is cool social agenda and the feminine and the women rights is the right time to join together with the ever demanding minority rights. By using this film to tell the public that these two minorities are far superior to the dominant white majority power. This Star Wars new flick just looked very childish and outdated with laughable story-line and scenarios, the screenplay looked like written by a bunch of Star Wars fans in junior high or high school dropouts, patching up a half-baked childish game plan to fool around. The graphics and special effects in this lousy film also looked terribly outdated and primitive, just blindly borrowed from the old flicks and never renewed even a bit. The only change was the rolling new droid. Nothing more and nothing else. Verdict: What a bomber! Those who involved in making this crap should be permanently banned from making any more movie.
ID_100057	Words cannot describe the perfection that is this film. JJ Abrams did a fantastic job, better than anything Lucas could do/ever has done. Solid cast, action, effects, everything. Go see this film, even if you're not a Star Wars fan, because you will become one. I'll definitely be seeing this multiple times, and I cannot wait to see the future of Star Wars in Episodes 8, 9 and the spin off movies. And thankfully, there isn't any Jar Jar Binks or young Anakin Skywalker. Instead we have interesting, diverse and excellently played characters. What a film.5/5 stars, 10/10, Best movie of 2015, Best Star Wars movie....by far : )
ID_100058	"J.J. Abrams has crafted a fantastic new episode of Star Wars in the classic style of the original trilogy, restoring competence, humor, convincing dialogue and acting, thrills, spills and chills. He has created new, likable characters that the audience can actually get behind, instead of be annoyed, disconnected and detached from, as in the widely-derided prequel trilogy. The film was (thankfully) crafted as the ""anti-prequel."" Don't believe the chorus of entitled nerds who set their own unrealistic personal expectations for the film and got mad when the film wasn't the perfect fulfillment of those demands. The film has been widely praised by professional critics as one of the best films of 2015. Abrams has brought Star Wars back, and has left Star Wars fans hungry for more!..............Ten X- )"
ID_100059	The original cast is back and fits in beautifully with the new crew. The CGI are great and the movie as a whole is A MASTERPIECE.This movie did a brilliant job of taking new actors with a new story (this is Star Wars for the new generation after all) and combined them with the original actors and clever references to the original trilogy. The dialogue was perfect for this movie (and very much in JJ Abrams' style) with just enough witty banter and clever one liners to keep you amused amidst all the serious action.And finally that brings me to the action. it was believable, and was perfectly reminiscent of the original trilogy. It is its own wonderful movie but is still definitively Star Wars. I recommend this to any fan of the franchise, any younger fans, fans of a good action and adventure movie, or fans of just incredible filmmaking period!
ID_100060	From the the intro to the very end credits, I had goosebumps all the  way. Ignore the hate, because this was the best Star Wars movie so far,  I can't wait for Episodes 8 and 9.  I smiled all the way and never had so much joy in a cinema before. This  movie gives you the Star Wars feeling we all love from the original  trilogy. I wanted to go to the toilet so bad, but I got so in into  movie I never went. The film is simply brilliant. It is not in anyway a  remake of Episode 4, they should try actually re-watching A New Hope.    I recommend this movie to everyone!
