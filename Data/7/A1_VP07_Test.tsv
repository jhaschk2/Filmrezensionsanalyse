ID_100181	"Star Wars TFA is not a bad movie it's just meh. My biggest gripe with this movie is the blatant hypocrisy among movie goers, because this movie has more in common with the recent Transformer movies than Star Wars. It's a long winded awkwardly paced cgi fest with misplaced humor. When people say this ""captures the magic"" I really don't know what they're smoking...we must have saw different movies. One of the other major problems with the movie is that all the characters felt the same (few exceptions) this is due to the overly comedic script where people are constantly quipping back and forth and have an observational joke for literally everything. These forced comedic elements really took me out of the film, just by sheer volume alone. However the film has redeeming qualities like Kylo Ren he's just about the only innovation in it, everything else was been there done that better."
ID_100182	Greetings again from the darkness. In what can justifiably be termed a cultural event, director J.J. Abrams brings us Episode VII in a film franchise that date backs almost 40 years. While I was one of the lucky ones who waited patiently in line to see the first Star Wars on opening day in 1977, I can only be described as a series fan rather than a Star Wars geek. My bond is with Hans Solo and Chewbaca, so this is not the place to debate the minutiae of costumes, timelines and weaponry.What I can happily report is that Mr. Abrams (he's also directed Star Trek and Mission Impossible films) has found just the right blend of nostalgia, science-fiction, and geeky gadgetry to appeal to the widest of all audiences. The film is an honorable tribute to the previous six in the series, yet it's more than entertaining enough to stand alone for new comers.As we expect and hope for, the screen is filled with fantastical visuals that somehow push our imagination, while at the same time, feel realistic to the story and action. The aerial dogfights are adrenaline-pumping and spectacular in their vividness, and the more grounded action scenes feature Stormtroopers who have clearly had lots of target practice since the previous films.You need only watch the trailer or read the credits to know that some of the old familiar faces are back: Harrison Ford as Han Solo, Mark Hamill as Luke Skywalker, Carrie Fisher as Princess Leia, Peter Mayhew as Chewbaca, and of course, our old pals C-3P0 and R2D2. Also back is the remarkable composer John Williams – likely to receive his fiftieth (yes, 50!) Oscar nomination for his work here. In addition to the familiar, new faces abound: John Boyega as Finn, Daisy Ridley as Rey, Adam Driver as Kyle (don't call me Ben) Ren, Oscar Isaac as Poe, Gwendoline Christie as Captain Phasma, and Domhnall Gleeson as Captain Hux. There is also the magic of Andy Serkis as Supreme Leader Snoke, and an all-too-brief sequence featuring Max von Sydow. Oscar winner Lupita Nyong'o voices Maz Kanata, and there is an impressive list of other cameos available online if you are interested (Daniel Craig being the most eye-raising).Abrams along with action cinematographer extraordinaire Daniel Mindel take full advantage of all available technical aspects in creating stunning visuals and spine-tingling sound. It's a film made to be watched on the biggest screen with the best sound system, so ask around if you aren't sure. If you are a long-time fan of Han and Chewy, you'll enjoy catching up with old friends. If you are unfamiliar with the Star Wars galaxy, this latest will hook you into the force.
ID_100183	At long last we have been given a Star Wars movie that takes full advantage of what the universe has to offer. JJ Abrams has shown that he can handle a movie of this kind and balance all the elements that makes up the movie. I was, more or less, at the edge of my seat from start to finish, since I didn't want to miss the story when it really kicked off. And the movie kept me in suspense in a brilliant way, so that I never had a moments rest, and thus was fully entertained from start to finish. What really made me happy to see was that lots of the problems found in previous movies wasn't a problem here. In episode 1 - 3, it bothered me that the special effects had taken over to such a degree, that any story and acting was strangled. This is not the case in TFA. Here the effects are balanced so that, there are enough to blow you away, but tempered so that the story shines through and the actors get to show what they can do. In episode 1-6 we mostly see either under- or overacting. Of course some did a great job. It was a joy to see a movie where the acting was as it should be. In short, JJ Abrams has made the movie Star Wars fans have deserved and waited for.
ID_100184	"""This will begin to make things right."" The film starting with that line infuriates me. Though the prequels are not held in high esteem, the thought that this movie would course correct the franchise is asinine. Starting on a self-righteous note definitely leaves a sour note.That being said, this movie is a solid entry in the Star Wars universe. The ground work is set and it's a good re-introduction to the galaxy far, far away. The plot is formulaic and follows the structure of ""A New Hope"" very closely. That's not a bad thing, but it does lack some originality. The new trio of Rey, Finn and Poe is interesting. The legacy of the original trio, while in the background, is a joy to watch.There are some chill inducing moments, most coming in the third act involving one of the heroes and Kylo Ren. The humor wasn't too much for me and I found myself enjoying the banter between the characters. The lightsaber choreography is weaker than the prequels, but the action as a whole is decent.In the end, I like ""The Force Awakens"". It's definitely better than episodes 1 and 2, but worse than 3, 4, and 5. I find myself putting this movie in the same tier as ""Return of the Jedi"".Best Character: Finn
Best Moment: Rey force grabbing the lightsaber.Best Quote: ""The Belonging You Seek Is Not Behind You... It Is Ahead."" - Maz Kanata."
ID_100185	This is my review for Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens (spoiler free).This film delivers well to fans of all ages and is the sequel fans have been waiting for, for 32 years. With amazing dialogue and explosive special effects I promise that when you leave the theater you won't be disappointed. Let's start with some the good points of why I think this is the film of the year: 1. Characters: This film has some new characters like Finn (John Boyega), Rey (Daisy Ridley) and Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac), Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) these characters deliver the plot of the film well along with some the older characters like Han Solo, Princess Leia, Chebacca and C-3PO.2. Plot: This films plot follows the plot form Episode VI Return of the Jedi and is a very good continuation to the story.3. Special Effects: The special effects are explosive and are a key element to the film to make this a hell of a sci-fi epic.Those are the good points on why I think you should watch this film and the bad points well there are none because this film was enjoyable from beginning to end. I think that the force has truly awakened in this film but that's for you to judge. If you are a Star Wars fan old or new this film should be at the top of your list. 10/10 an excellent must see bring on Dec 2017 for Episode VIII. Must see.
ID_100186	"Disney has taken Star Wars and PC-ed it to no shame.From the trailer, when it was first shown, the first comments feminists stated was how wonderful to see a black, a female and a Latino together and no white males. How wonderful it is for the world.Sci-Fi used to be made for men and it was great. Now what we have is the female awakening and Disney pandering to the fake audience and snot nosed kids who think Taylor Swift is an exceptional singer.This is made for the Disney Generation, the kids who were in diapers when the PREQUELS got made. The current SJW's, BLM's and feminists will adore this film as all creativity is gone, replaced with plot stolen from the first trilogy. At least the prequels tried to be original. Episode 7 is just stealing.This was a wet dream for many and the female lead is a unicorn. Untrained in the force, she is more powerful than Luke, Vader, Palpatine and Old Ben combined. They even ripped off Yoda with a female who was supposed to be older than Yoda but with more vitality? They made sure you knew it was not your daddy's Star Wars many times. While male Yoda was old and fragile, the older female Yoda was spry and hits on Chewy.It is devoid of real substance and plot. Instead it is BIGGER Deathstar? We have Stormtroopers but not Stormtropper, they are FIrst Order Troopers? Palpatine but not Palpatine as we have Snoke aka Gollum? There were a couple of scenes that made sure to let you know who they were pandering to. During the Rebels attacking the First order; the camera cuts to a Black pilot, then Asian female pilot, Alien, Alien, Latino. I chalked this up to everyone else accusing men of being chauvinistic, but another scene they did it again making sure you know this was NOT your daddy's Star Wars. This movie had cheesy one liners meant for kids to laugh to cover up plot holes. There was ZERO memorable scenes or musical scores. They even tried to re-hash the shock of ""I am your father,"" but obviously it fell flat.This reminds me of Terminator Genysis. They sacrificed the real fans who loved T1 and T2, for the bratty snot nosed PC crowd who loves everything they are told to love. Hipsters at their best who rely on others to make decisions for them.Luke was a side character and a rehash of Obi. Same out fit to boot. He is looking for, I kid you not, the FIRST Jedi Temple. This was a very videogamey plot to explain how the Empir.....I mean First Order rises. This movie lacked drama and seemed to be scenes just strung together. The characters were emotionless robots. Han and Leia had no chemistry. My gosh they had a kid and were together for a long time. In fact Han, Chewy, C3PO and R2D2 were just thrown in as an afterthought and to make money off the REAL fans.The plot actually has the Empire being annihilated by the First Order. This was the writers letting you know that this ""Star Wars is for the new generation and too bad real fans, Disney needs more money and the Disney/Gamer/SJW generation will give it.""Star Wars TFA was a letdown. it is not a continuation but a remake, a re-imagining, a poorer re-telling of the originals except BIGGER DeathStar;BIGGER Dark Lords; BIGGER explosions; BIGGER, BIGGER, BIGGER!!!! If you are a Hipster easy 8, If you are a purist, it is a 5. This is truly an SJW's wet dream."
ID_100187	This movie was by far the best movie of 2015. Go in with normal expectations and you will come out deeply content. Loved every bit of it. The movie has all the big bangs, flight sequences and special effects that you come to expect from a great Star Wars movie. I rarely watch a movie twice (the last one was The Dark Knight) but I cannot wait to re-visit this epic for another round. Counting the days until the next one!
ID_100188	First of all, the movie is not as bad as many others review it here. But the essence of these reviews is true: It just mirrors what Hollywood has become today. Episode VII is a uninspired ripoff of somebody else's ideas and therefore has no soul. But what is really annoying, considering the professionals involved, it has a poorly written script. It feels like a first draft that has been rushed into production. Abrams knows his job, he wrote Super 8, which is a well written movie. And Kasdan co-wrote Empire Strikes Back, which is the best star wars ever. I don't know what happened, maybe they tried to make it great and some studio boss messed it up. Or they didn't have enough time to make it right. Probably Abrams is just too busy producing. I wonder how the movie had turned out if a writer with a master skill set like Aaaron Sorkin or Quentin Tarrantino had written the script. Writers who really know their craft and can build up scenes that work for the story. This movie had, except a couple of good punchlines, not one well written scene. And that's too bad as Abrams knows how to direct a well written script.But there is something else missing in the writing than technical skills. What made the original trilogy great? Lucas did his research about ancient myths, archetypes, he referenced masterpieces of legend filmmakers (e.g. Kurosawa), he dug really deep and put all his creativity and passion into building a breathtaking world full of ideas. He was taking risks. But episode 7 just repeats what has worked before, without inventing something new. But maybe there is hope: Ryan Johnson could at least fix some of it and make a reasonable movie as he is also one of those talented writers out there. If they let him. Please do. Maybe the new trilogy becomes something like the matrix in reverse by starting terrible (matrix 3) and becoming really great (matrix 1). But there is one BIG problem now: the falcon is empty.
ID_100189	The force truly has awakened! Any one who is even a casual fan of Star Wars will tell you that this movie is the very essence of what Star Wars stands for in all of its wondrous glory. The cast was very well selected, it's very clear that they selected the right people to populate the new generation of the universe, and that J.J. Abrams is, indeed, the man for the job. It really comes as no surprise that Abrams was able to do the series justice, but it was indeed refreshing to see to what extent. The scenery was so amazing, and the new planets, while the terrain was not exactly original, Jakku was kind of a clone to Tatooine, but the village was vastly different to that of anything from the originals, or the prequels. If the fans will be very honest with themselves, these planets were refreshing in a very, very grim way. Then there's the story, while it was not entirely original, it did bring about the necessary setting and development to help us along with our new characters and their full introductions, as well as a deeper look into their psyches. Not to mention a revisit from our main cast in the originals. Though it may seem a little forced (no pun intended), it did not hinder the story in any way, in fact much of it was very much needed.The film itself was gripping in every positive manner, and there were even some genuinely hysterical moments! It didn't need to dumb it down for children, as there is proof that even some of the younger kids liked, even loved this movie, and there were sounds of begging for their mothers to bring them back to see it again. Take that Jar Jar, you old HACK! Now, let's get down to brass tax, was it good? Yes. Was it great? YES! Was it as good as the first one? Well, break my skull if you want, but YES YES YES it was actually just as good as the first trilogy, and that is coming from someone who grew up with the original trilogy on VHS. It was amazing. We are very fortunate to have the opportunity to see it in theaters, and own it on Blu-Ray, and we much NOT let that chance get away from us. So what are you doing still reading this review? GO SEE IT!!!!
ID_100190	"A perfect beginning. I remember when the trailer of this came out. I was so hyped. ""STAR WARS IS BACK!!"" I said, and I was right. This movie is what star wars is about. And I never quite understood the ""A New Hope Rehash"" comments. Sure I get it sometimes. But come on, this is Star Wars. Most of the times the basic concepts are the same. Villain, hero, wise master who guides hero, end fight with fighters. Also the death of one character didn't feel forced, it felt right for the character and i love it. It's amazing how almost all star wars movies are insanely good. Man, I love star wars....and that's the feeling you're supposed to get watching these films."
ID_100191	This movie had so much potential to open a great trilogy. Movie as it self is good but it's copying a bit too much New hope
ID_100192	"Well 30 years have passed since the last, ""GOOD"" star wars movie, and with the current fashion of going back to a franchise that was meant to end a long time ago (more star puns coming) here comes episode 7 , the 7th entry to this franchise that seems to be having a mixed opinion amongst it's viewers. Before starting up with this review let me be really clear about the fact , that the force is strong with this one , and we are back in to the good ol' Star wars. This movie is definitely not the best star wars movie made, but it isn't a movie worth slashes of 1 and 2 ratings either. And in this review I will explain and justify my opinion with absolutely no spoilers.1)Story :- It is apparent and absolutely obvious , that most of the concerns that people have with this movie , is the fact that this is a re-hash or re-telling of episode 5 – a new hope. While that is probably a good way to explain the story, I believe that force awakens has a plot that rises way above that assumption. Now the first 10 minutes of this movie might feel extremely and creepily similar to a new hope with a lot of recurring events , but a whole new setting and a whole new motivation for both new and returning characters make this movie a surprisingly different story telling experience , with obviously lot of notable flaws. One of the biggest concerns I have with this movie is the now obvious presence of a yet another death star. But on my second viewing it is pretty much apparent that a new death star like object was a necessary plot device used by JJ Abrams to actually bind the team to fight against an actual threat to the galaxy. Not just that , the story being written by a fan and not the creationist , opens varied opportunities to add elements to the plot that not just benefit the viewer on an artistic level , but makes the world feel more burst out with familiar details and focused lore building ideas. The story does a fantastic job in slowly carrying in the new cast to hold the franchise for it's future releases , and is a great and exciting start to the now post Lucas trilogy , and feels like this movie was made and tailored perfectly for a new generation of star wars fans.2)Casting and Characters :- Now bringing in the old cast and crew into the story was a bold and perfect choice , as we know exactly how a star wars movie devoid of the original cast strength faired amongst the audience. While the performances of the returning cast is superb as usual , what really caught my eye was the new team. Daisy Ridley as Rey , John Boyega as Finn and Adam Driver as Kylo Ren and also my favorite Poe played by Oscar Isaac were all brilliant with the character that they portrayed on screen. The 1000 word limit and the presence of some serious spoilers really restrict me from over explaining these characters , but I am sure that every viewer would love the way these new characters take up and share screen space during the entire runtime of this movie. Now moving on to the returning cast , the only 2 people that really stood out was Han Solo and Chewbacca. These 2 people were not just phoned into the script for some nostalgic run but actually stood by the new generation to take them around the world of star wars and show them the galaxy far far away. Han Solo acts as the bridge between the old and new generation and is Han Solo at his best. Not to worry though , this is not the case of Crystal Skull. Lupita was good with the role that was given to her too acting as Maz Kanata. And finally do not expect much from Captain Phasma or Supreme Leader Snoke as these are characters that were just introduced into the plot and hopefully will be used responsibly in the future movies. While many of the side characters did not receive justifiable screen time , it is to rightfully experience and develop the characters of the new generation that will potentially lead the franchise for the next 2 movies of this trilogy. On a whole , both the returning and the new cast gel well to provide an all good performance to make us feel like we are back home.3)Direction:- What I was extremely scared about when I heard JJ Abrams was the director of this movie was that he might Abrafy this movie with quick cuts , shaky cams and lens flare. But the first 10 minutes of this movie provided me with some much needed re- assurance. JJ Abrams directs some beautiful set-pieces, and this movie does not lack that. There are plenty of wide shots with the sky and other subtle elementary backgrounds with the proper clean and practical colour and light choices that ultimately grounds the movie to reality unlike the CGI garbage in the prequels. Also, the use of practical effects makes this movie much more real and obviously sings the song of return thus making this movie closer and closer to the masterpieces that the original movies were. A lot of modifications done by JJ Abrams to the script runs in combination with his direction and idea of the next generation of this franchise , whose take is absolutely appreciated. His direction and his keen liking of the franchise as a fan makes this movie a fan made passion project that every fan would love.Ultimately , this is a movie that is better than the trash prequels and goes way above the CGI overkill to live close with the original trilogy."
ID_100193	"It is surprising that only 10 to 12 hours of films created the giant franchise we know as Star Wars. People have been waiting for a good Star Wars story ever since Episode 6 came out 32 years ago. Fellow Star Wars fans, I am pleased to tell you, it has come. Everyone knows Star Wars is a sci-fi, action franchise, but this film is very unique for the fact that it goes much deeper. With Evil getting more and more powerful, there is drama and fighting between the characters, but that doesn't stop romance from sneaking in with a little bit of comedy. Granted, I was worried it would turn into a kid's comedy, but quite a few times I found my self thinking that not only are the jokes perfect, they are also not over used! Alright, let's get to the part everyone wants to read, the plot of the most hyped, but hidden film of the decade. The events start out 20 years after what took place in Episode 6, (spoiler alert for people who didn't see episode 6). The Empire has fallen, yes, but a new Evil has risen, known as The First Order. The rebellion needs new Jedi now more than ever, but Luke (Mark Hamill) is missing and they need to find (wait for it) a new hope! Is the film worth the wait? Ever since almost a year ago, people have been talking about new Star Wars episode, and it is SO worth it. Famous directors have taken on some great challenges before, including Spielberg finishing Kubrick's AI. But J.J. Abrams took on something completely out of the ball field trying to continue Star Wars. The cinematography is spectacular, the ending shot (no spoiler) is one of the greatest endings I have ever seen in a film, and the whole story itself is unexpected and very enjoyable. Although there are many aspects that are not in the original Star Wars films, I think it is actually very nice to see Star Wars not get ruined, but go through its own evolving evolution. As for the acting, of course, the original A-Team - Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher and more – are phenomenal and I think it was the perfect idea to bring these characters back for the pure enjoyment of long standing fans. However, it is really Daisy Ridley who steals the show. Her character, Rey, is so fresh and unique, full of emotion, and this character (still no spoilers, sorry) goes through so much drama in the film. It must have been a very hard role to play. Daisy gives it 110%. I predict she will be win an Oscar nomination for this role. The special effects obviously got better since the last Star Wars film in the early 2000s, and I still want to mention how breathtaking they are. Even for 2015, with all the CGI aliens, ships and spectacular space scenes, it is quite literally ""eye candy."" My only criticism of the film is that it is a bit too long. However, not one single scene is out of place or feels unneeded. One of my favorite scenes is when we are reunited with Hollywood's favorite space ship. Rey and Finn (John Boyega) are trying to escape The First Order. They have two options for space flight, a ""piece of junk"" or another space ship. Well, the space ship gets blown up and it turns out the ""piece of junk"" is the millennium falcon! Of course, everyone cheers, claps and whistles in the audience once the camera shows the breathtaking ship. It is not only enjoyable, and a bit funny, but the camera technique is perfect. If you want to know the rest of the story, go get your tickets and watch the film! This film is actually pretty mature. It isn't as kind as episodes 1, 2 and 3. It has its violence, so I recommend it for ages ten to eighteen. And, adults who saw previous Star Wars films and appreciate them will enjoy this film as well. I give it five out of five stars, because, even if it is a little bit boring in the middle, (it is 2 hours and 10 minutes long) J.J. Abrams, the cast and crew achieved the impossible and created a new masterpiece that can be proudly added to the Star Wars franchise. I am also glad to say that, for the first time in over 20 years, Star Wars returns! You can see Star Wars: The Force Awakens in theaters starting December 18th! Reviewed by Gerry O., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic."
ID_100194	"Few franchises are as cherished and as glorious as Star Wars. Since its release in 1977, it has been passed down by hardcore fans to their children in the form of repeated viewings on VHS or DVD like a precious family heirloom, or has simply found itself etched in a young child's mind with no help from their parents. My generation endured the often tarnished prequels, but even if you're somebody who despises the franchise's prequels and embraces ""the original trilogy,"" think about that; you dislike one-half of the series, but you still have the nerve to call yourself a Star Wars fan. That's because the Star Wars characters, universe, and experience transcends a few subpar films; it's something that reminds us why we go see films in the first place and how they can completely transport us out of our element for an experience that we'll always hold dear to our hearts and cherish until we pass.There will undoubtedly be people quick to praise Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens as the best film in the series, or even second to The Empire Strikes Back, and there will be the hardcore fans that will simply not allow themselves to enjoy it for whatever reasons exist under the sun. For me, as a casual fan of the franchise, I wanted a compelling cast of new characters, the same kind of enriching and unique environments I had been graced with in prior installments, a desire on the screenwriters' behalf to propel things forward and not dwell on nostalgia and past events, and offer up some new thrills in a modern, but classic package.If you go into Star Wars: The Force Awakens expecting that, I'm convinced you will get it and emerge satisfied. The film may not have the kind of warmth and tingly feelings you got when you first witnessed the original Star Wars film in the theaters, on VHS, or in one of its theatrical re-releases. Through a lens that packs confidence and lacks flare, J.J. Abrams continues the franchise in a respectful and commendable way.To keep the plot's description as vague as possible, the film takes place roughly thirty years after the events of Return of the Jedi, where Luke Skywalker has disappeared and the galaxy is left dominated by the First Order, the successor to the Galactic Empire, and the Resistance, both trying to find Luke's whereabouts. We focus on a Stormtrooper nicknamed Finn (John Boyega), who escapes the First Order with a Resistance pilot named Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac), along with BB-8, a small, round droid. Their ultimate goal is to destroy the First Order, which is commanded by Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), who uses the dark side of the force to command and conquer. Later in the film, Finn teams up with a scavenger named Rey (Daisy Ridley), in addition to both Han Solo (Harrison Ford reprising his iconic role) and Chewbacca in efforts to defeat Ren and take back the Galactic Empire.To begin with, in an effort most likely geared to try to disassociate this project from the often tarnished prequels, Abrams takes the safe route in structuring The Force Awakens's narrative in a manner very similar to A New Hope. The chronological events of attacks, character development and introductions, and cause-and-effect relationships all mirror the film that started it all, and this isn't a bad thing, frankly. To try and hatch a new experimental structure to a film that's already going to be approached very cautiously by fans who are fearful of the Disney brand now stamped on all future Star Wars projects and products is a very risky move, and Abrams does a great job at playing safe, yet still delivering.This isn't to say that Abrams and his cowriters Lawrence Kasdan and Michael Arndt cling to a railing for support and safety the entire time; in fact, making the leading male in the film black and the other lead a woman is a high-point for the film, especially given how engaging these characters are. Boyega gives one of the most naturally charismatic and engaging performances I've yet to see in a Star Wars film, full of energy and not one-liners or quips that distract from the story at hand. Ridley, too, finds herself being a very believable presence, especially when tasked with carrying much of the emotional weight in the last act. Finally, let's not sleep on Oscar Isaac, who, this year alone, has had performances range from business tycoons, laidback but sinister scientists, and now a key role in one of the most renowned franchises in history. As with nearly every project he has been in, don't sleep on him here, either.Star Wars: The Force Awakens, in addition to being the best-acted installment of the original franchise, also happens to be one of the most exhilarating action spectacles of the year. With the effects being delightful blends of CGI and practical effects, the feel the film carries throughout mixes the old and the new with great results. The film doesn't bear the laborious and often artificial looks of recent blockbusters like Godzilla or Jurassic World, but it doesn't look poorly or inexpensively assembled either. This is an incomparably detailed film, especially during the first hour, when it's essentially the best sound and lights show you could ask for.I came for an experience and I was wholly satisfied having witnessed what I did before I walked out. This is a film that will likely inspire and captivate a good majority of its audience, and remind them why they love films in the first place. It's a lovely blend of old and new that doesn't rely on nostalgia to carry its story, and offers viewers a new breed of likable souls to carry this franchise to galaxies even farther and farther away, perhaps next time to uncharted territory."
ID_100195	It's an awful film, I'm just giving it a 2 because it actually had a beginning, a middle and an end.I haven't watched any of the Star Wars movies. This was my first.Objectively, as a movie, this was exactly like any of the recent blockbusters I've wasted my money on the last decade.Vehicles chasing each other and blowing stuff up, villains unable to find the target, actions that defy all laws of physics, cliché dialogue with no depth and stupid one-liners, and basically a film designed for IQ's anywhere between 0 and 50.If there was a unique story behind all this, I failed to see it.This film was plain bad.8.7Really IMDb? Really??
ID_100196	Let me start by saying I didn't know what to expect before going to see this movie. Last night we were standing in line and you could feel the anxiety of everyone looking forward to this film.THIS IS THE BEST STAR WARS YET!Let me tell you why...All the actors can act - Everyone from Daisy Ridley to Adam Driver gave stunning performances. It's the first Star Wars movie I have ever seen where the acting was worthy all around.Great Directing - The only movie that can rival this one as far as directing goes was Empire. They are both on the same level. Needless to say this movie is leaps and bounds beyond the prequels. Great job JJ!It's Funny - Remember watching Jar Jar Binks and wanting to punch a hole in something? There is none of that nonsense in this movie. There are lot's of laughs and it has the same comedic value of the originals.Great Action! Action, and more Action!There are a few twists and a few tears to be shed. I honestly felt emotion while watching this movie. And that hasn't happened since the Empire Strikes Back. Everyone leaving the theater also loved the movie... You can usually tell an audience reaction to a movie by their interaction... and they were loud!
ID_100197	"Kathleen Kennedy and JJ Abrams have delivered the best Star Wars movie since Return of the Jedi, and it may be the best one ever. This is the Star Wars movie fans in 2015 have longed for.All of the actors knocked it out of the park. Daisy Ridley was wonderful as the lead. John Boyega had a great mix of confidence and reluctance. I wasn't expecting to care much for Oscar Isaac's character, but I was pleasantly surprised at how likable he was.Adam Driver: wow! I loved the inner conflict he brought. The fact that he lost his temper a couple of times was great. You feel like anything is possible with a villain like that. Unlike Hayden Christiansen who came across as a whiny, baby in the prequels, Driver plays it wonderfully.This movie had the perfect blend of drama, humor, and action. The humor was more in line with the original trilogy, but slightly updated for a modern age. The action was the same as the humor in that it felt like the original trilogy but was slightly updated; there were some great action shots like the Millennium Falcon grazing the sand during takeoff on Jakku and the turnaround the Falcon made just before it went into the exhaust port on an old Imperial ship.I have so many thoughts about this movie, and I can probably articulate them more completely after I've had a second viewing. For now, I'll just say that Star Wars is back, and not in the sad, pathetic way it was back in 1999, 2002, and 2005; I mean it is really back!"
ID_100198	I was so excited when the prequels came, having always loved the original trilogy. I was a bit disappointed with them, but still enjoyed them. This movie brought back the magic of the originals, with a fresh cast and goosebumps at the returning characters. Not a perfect movie, but an awesome and welcome edition to the saga!
ID_100199	So, my daughter and I just came out of Star Wars. My short summary is it is a perfect mix of old and new, and an excellent movie, probably one of the top 10 movies I've seen in 5 years or more.I'm not sure what those who gave this 1 to 7 stars are thinking, it is FAR better than your average movie. Of course it was going to have throwbacks to the others, heck, it has several of the same characters in starring roles. I also thought the new characters were outstanding, especially Daisy Ridley as Rey. I don't want to give a play-by-play analysis of the movie, just that JJ Abrams is truly a great director, the movie is beautiful, the story is engrossing, sets are amazing, and the overall pace and feel of the movie is top notch! Does the movie feel familiar....well yes of course it does, because IT IS a Star Wars movie, and yes, it has some similar scenes to the other movies. That is a GOOD thing, and they are very well done, and the humor is very well done, but not overly done or corny. Again, the movie is a wonderful blend of everything good about Star Wars. I've noticed over the last 20-30 years, especially in the last 10, there is a percentage of the USA population that is so cynical and negative about EVERYTHING! Those people will never be happy, I see it all the time in movie reviews that are so ridiculously over hyper-critical, I see it life everyday. My advice to those people is to chill, relax, sit back, and smell the roses....try to enjoy life! Star Wars: The Force Awakens IS the real deal.
ID_100200	"Often, being an artist who creates something immensely popular is a tricky situation. A work of art, like a certain movie that a young twenty-something director by the name of George Lucas created in 1974, merges with the public consciousness and becomes part of the Zeitgeist. The problem is, artists are human beings. They grow and change and the way they see the world changes. But their art is frozen in time, a ""finished"" product that endures in peoples minds. Given sufficient time between their works, artists who come back to earlier projects have very different views, and that is reflected in their work.Fans, on the other hand, still remember and idolize the original works locked in the time when they grew to love them. When they hear that the artist is producing something new they want and expect a new work that brings them back to who they were when they fell in love with the original.Which brought us to Star Wars episodes I, II, and III. I think it would be fair to say a lot of fans were unhappy with, or at least less than thrilled with, those movies. The movies reflected Lucas' vision of his universe through his eyes twenty some years after he made the first trilogy, and it was different than what fans fell in love with.But for this new trilogy Lucas stepped aside to let a fan create the next chapter of his creation. J.J. Abrams grew up as a fan of the original three films like the rest of us and his work shows it. The new movie is very similar in themes and tone to the original works. Abrams eschews growth for comfort. If he was a chef it would be like forgoing a menu built by practicing molecular gastronomy for a menu with just perfect pizzas. I don't mean this as a knock at all; sometimes all you want is a great slice, and that's what Abrams has made. A perfect slice of the themes and visuals from the original trilogy.Daisy Ridley steps into Mark Hamill's shoes as the child about to start their journey into adulthood (and the force) very capably. With all respect to Mr Hamill, I would venture to say she is at least as capable an actor as he was when he held the role. Mr. Boyega, whom I see as spiritually stepping into the role of Han Solo, does a decent job, although maybe with just a touch less charisma than Ford in the originals, in my opinion.Adam Driver does an excellent job filling the role of villain, portraying a juvenile arrogance mixed with a juvenile insecurity and impulsiveness wrapped around a despicable earnestness in his adoration of evil.And finally, as in the original films, the droids play a strong role. BB-8 is amazing as the cool robot that you wish you could own with the adorable personality of a puppy. They provide comic relief during tense moments and express the audience's emotions during the tragic ones.Just for the sake of brevity I will say that the rest of the cast was excellent as well. With the exception of Oscar Isaac portraying the fighter pilot Poe Dameron and Harrison Ford reprising his original role, their roles were much more limited, but what screen time they did get was well done.So to sum it all up, this is the perfect film for fans of the original trilogy. With tons of references and call-backs to the originals, it will have everything you are looking for, done well and with a lot of heart. If you loved the original Star Wars, you will love this one as well. And if you are too young to have started with the original trilogy, this film is a great place to start a new love affair."
ID_100201	After a really long decade Star Wars is back! J.J. Abrams has done us proud. The Force Awakens, or episode VII (the first in a new trilogy of films to come every other year) as it's been named, is a superb science-fiction film. For the die-hard fans its only gripe is it's a little too familiar in territory, but that's genuinely it. For the newer, younger audiences, TFA leads a path to what's to come. When the blue letters 'A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away' followed by the trademark yellow words swiping up the starry backdrop, I felt like I was 11 again. There's a strong scent of nostalgia mixed in to the story, but for every old memory there's 10 new ones. So many emotions washed through me within a short space of time, as I know my expectations (and everyone else's) are, and were, going to be met. It only takes a few seconds to know we're in the capable hands of someone who's a major fan himself.Now briefly on to what he's given us. The light side hangs in the balance. The forces of darkness, now known as the First Order, are stronger, bigger, more formidable than ever before. Characters on either side are equal throughout. TFA opens up the SW universe. Jakku's desert looks splendid, derelict AT-AT walkers and Star Destroyers are left abandoned and new arrivals provide different personalities that I want to know so much more about. Adam Driver's Kylo Ren switches from intimidating foe to deeply torn adolescent. All five main newbies (Isaac's fighter pilot Poe, Ridley's feisty girl Ray, Boyega's runaway Fin, Gleeson's evil man Snoke and Driver's Sith) get there chance to shine, just as the older ones so dear to me do as well. I'm eager to see The Force Awakens again, and even more for the next chapter. Episode VII will keep me feeling happy and young for a long time after its release. Next up, a spin-off called Rogue One!
ID_100202	"...he'll want to smash the prequels with a large sledgehammer. If he's honest about his work, that is. Now he has the time because he's not involved in Star Wars fist hand... and ostensibly enough money to buy an appropriately large devastating device.Seeing this made me wish I never laid my eyes on the ""CGI, pseudoscience and politics masturbation"" that were the so called prequels. Because ""The Force Awakens"" is back to the roots for the franchise. There is the sense of adventure again, there is the sense of scope and the convincing journey from small to great for the main character. It also looks like the film again, not like a televised theater. Thanks to Mr. Abrams and the crew, they didn't let down by any means! The lengths they went to to make this as meaty and good and ""starwars-ish"" as it once used to be are obvious and only the most jaded fans, ""traumatized"" by recent experiences and firmly entrenched in their own preconceptions of what ""their"" franchise should be will disagree.After scanning through some reviews here on IMDb, I can see that there are quite a lot of disappointed folks. Two main objections to the new film is that it's derivative (""ripoff"") and that it has many illogical plot points (""stupid""). Well, excuse me, people, what show are we talking about? Show me one single episode of the ""Star Wars"" franchise that isn't both a ripoff and stupid, including the first one (or ""fourth"", if you will)! All are, but that fact didn't take anything off of the pleasure of seeing them until Mr. Lucas went overboard with his out-of-touch ideas of where to take the story next. It just goes to show that you can never please everyone, especially people who got exactly what they wanted but are so used to complaining by now that complaining entertains them more than the film itself.In a way, this new outing does feel like ""the best of Star Wars"" compilation and it does feel like retelling of ""A New Hope"" with some elements from ""Empire Strikes Back"" and ""Return of the Jedi"". However, Lucas himself had this concept of the trilogies ""rhyming with each other"" which makes it legitimate and it seems that the crew honored it well here. But there is a bigger purpose to that, because if this franchise is to be reinvigorated for a long period of time it has to put a firm statement of where it stands compared to the legacy. And the statement is ""we're putting it back where it was when people were genuinely attracted to the whole thing"". This is allowed by the position of this episode in the general timeline and made possible by the sure hand of a director that knows film-making inside out and is also clearly a fan.And obviously, since new people do bring new ideas, many things from the lore are rethought and revised in a very refreshing way, and while you may not find it in the storyline, you'll certainly find it in little amusing details, my favorite being the scene where the new main villain has a fit of rage and his underlings quietly avoid him until he settles down. Yes, that's right: the characters finally feel like human beings again.Is this all good for the future of ""Star Wars""? In this age of remakes, sequels and reboots this franchise isn't a vanguard anymore and can't really open new frontiers. It now has to compete for the middle ground with a fiercely stiff competition. And despite its zealous following, I believe that ordinary audience sees it by now as something of a relic from a bygone era. Taking this as an advantage, and making it look and feel like it used to be, and refreshing it where it was needed, could be a good way to not only set it apart from other blockbusters but to retain respect for something that once made a profound cultural impact, and the production took solid steps in that direction. So, yeah, it's like restoration of a vintage car. And it works and it will still roll for quite some time.All in all, ""Star Wars"" is really back. Back with all its poignance and back with all its silliness. And they do look good! I take two marks off of ten because... well, because it's ""Star Wars""! It's my own thing, don't be bothered by it. I lost the taste for them a long time ago in a childhood far, far away. But I do admit that something in this made me feel like looking forward to sequels just like I did after I saw ""Episode V"" in cinema at the tender age of six."
ID_100203	Alright, I would like to compare it to the original Lucas trilogy. Youngsters might find this movie very entertaining if they have not watched those old good movies. However, the older audience who ever watched the 1977, 1980 & 1983 movies would have much higher expectations. Plot: This move has nothing much to add to the 3 originals. Repeating the same old story. Only few twists, but let's not spoil them here.Special effects: The BB-8 droid is the greatest part in the entire movie. It is deserved to be called the lead character. All other space ships and fighters are getting old and boring. Same old TIE fighters and X-Wings.Cast: Good to see many of the old crew back in the movie.Overall: Fine for wasting some time, hanging out with youngsters to watch the movie together.
ID_100204	"One can only have deep respect and admiration for a genius individual like J.J. Abrams I think one of the most difficult things to accomplish in the film industry is to revive a legendary and immeasurably popular franchise, but Abrams achieved in doing so not just once – with ""Star Trek"" – but now twice, with the even more astounding new ""Star Wars"" installment. ""Star Trek"" and ""Star Wars"" aren't just your average type of successful Sci-Fi movies, no, they became so humongous that they became immortal cult phenomena with millions of obsessive fans, countless of spin-offs and imitations and merchandising business that started to lead a life of their own. In order to appeal to this many skeptical and demanding fans, your film just has to be really, REALLY good! ""Episode VII: The Force Awakens"" is a fantastic film, and even though I'm not an avid ""Star Wars"" admirer, it was the first one since ""The Empire Strikes Back"" that truly impressed and overwhelmed me. Episodes I, II and III, that were released between 1999 and 2005 and directed by George Lucas himself, were not exactly worshiped by the die-hard SW-fans. Arguably that's because Mr. Lucas wrote and directed the prequels from a creator's point of view and not enough from a fan-boy's perspective. Abrams clearly is a big fan of the saga and probably knows more about Lucas' creation than he does himself, and that makes him the ideal person to helm the next generation of Star Wars cinema. ""The Force Awakens"" has a solid and absorbing scenario, breathtaking decors and set-pieces, spectacular action scenes (brought to an even higher level of awesomeness thanks to the exquisite 3D) and – perhaps the most important of all – a truly excellent and versatile cast of characters. First and foremost there's the return of some legendary heroes, of course, like Han Solo and Chewbacca, but also the newly introduced protagonists are fascinating characters. Personally, I've always been most attracted to the Dark Side, so I adored the new and powerful foe Kylo Ren (and particularly his private mental battle), the relentless army General Hux and the rather disturbing Supreme Leader Snoke. But also the good guys are extremely likable, like tough girl Rey and the reshaped Stormtrooper Finn. I can't wait for episodes 8 and 9!"
ID_100205	"Story: the script written by Abraams himself along with Lawrence Kasdan (who co-wrote ""Empire"" and ""Jedi"") is a solid block of fan service towards Episode IV. It follows identical story patterns - desert planet, kid ready to go off on adventure, mentor comes along the way,etc - but some nice (humorous) twists left and right. Although it delivers with no cringe-worthy scenes, Abraams seems to be focused too much in ""New Hope"" as he tries avoid the (hilarious) wrath of the internet fan boys. Whereas this is not necessarily a bad decision, it would be been a greater challenge to try to distinguish his film from old ties and allow himself to follow our (old and new) heroes in different settings rather than familiar ones. Of course, this is Star Wars, it had never been about breaking the rules or groundbreaking story material, it is all about family relationships. Themes: The character interaction is worth the price of the admission alone and it is simply magical to see all those icons that you love talking to each. Main focus here remains the connections between them and the family ties that each one may carry on their shoulders. It had always been a eye catching dynamic that has been explored in the last six films successfully - how Luke reacts to his father's news, how Anakin is going to save Padme, etc - and if it is not broken why fix it? Abraams knows he has a goldmine of characters the audience is willing to see in action surrounded by love, betrayal, friendship, care and heroism and commits rightfully so.Characters: Episode VII boasts a phenomenal cast - from the main protagonist duo to the film's primary villain. It's a pleasure to have Harrison Ford back as Han Solo with the most scene stealing moments and his chemistry with Fisher and Mayhew (Chewbacca) still holds strong since 1983. It is evident that Ford is having a blast at the iconic role and it seems that it has not passed a day since the concluding events of the ""Return of the Jedi"". Carrie Fisher has little screen time (unexpectedly) but does justice to the material and regarding Mark Hamill's appearance much cannot be said without giving anything away. Among the newcomers, Daisy Ridley makes a strong impact - likable, fierce and vulnerable - she brings a freshness to the Star Wars myths by being almost at the center of the story in a rather dominant boy- ish series. John Boyega is surprisingly charismatic (and amps the humor to 11!) although his character is rather blunt sometimes and feels like filler. Other wellknown cast members are either minimized cameos - Max Von Sydow, Gwendoline Christie come to mind, what a waste!, or glorified ones - looking at you Oscar Isaac. and this is where the film mostly crumbles. An overabundance of characters offer almost nothing at the proceedings instead they are used as an excuse to move the plot forward. It is admirable that Abraams tries to recreate a vivid world of Star Wars but at one point, we are not caring for most of them as they carry almost no significance or dramatic weight.Villain: The best element in the film, main player here is Kylo Ren portrayed by Adam Driver. A rather menacing (and badass) presence, his story arc is by far the most interesting with some nifty emotional touches. Driver plays Ren's obsession/confusion to perfection and surely has the most development in the movie. Not only, he summarizes what is wrong with the dark side, tiny little details regarding his emotional attributes build up his character without requiring much heavy handed exposition or long monologues. At this part, Abraams and Co have succeeded tremendously and Driver's performance carries a dramatic (and tragic) weight reminding the glory of ""Revenge of the Sith""'s final act.Direction: Abraams' direction is solid, dynamic and evidently from the Star Trek entries serviceable with similar blended display of CGI and practical effects. However, despite the presence of some inspiring dog fight sequences, Abraams seems to struggle with the lightsaber battle suffering from close ups and intense edit despite the atmospheric setting. It is always good to see no lens flare! - thank you for that - and him trying to keep consistent with the visual flare of the previous films. Following George Lucas's directing (and static) style with a bit of more dramatic movement in the space scenes feels like a natural evolution for a modern entry in the SW canon. Particularly, there is a wonderful shot of Finn fighting his way through a Stormtrooper squad while on the background Dameron is blasting lasers on Tie-fighters. Brilliant. however, it does not bring back any memorable moments due to his insistence to follow the patterns of Episode IV. Although there is a clear enthusiasm, he gets caught in his own excitement to recreate probably his nostalgia. All six films boasted some truly memorable set pieces (Vader vs Luke in Empire, Duel of the fates scene, pd race, Emperor confrontation in Jedi) or visual style (who can forget the almost renaissance like lava landscapes of Mustafar?), yet here, despite the state of the art talent involved, the films feels more a fan service checklist rather than a fully fleshed out adventure.Despite being a technical thrill and a treat for the holiday season, Episode VII though lacks any emotional punch while it is focused on pulling off the nostalgia flag rather than initiate excitement with something new. Abraams has done a serviceable job as the franchise's first helmer with adequate action scenes and a great cast. He falls short though as he sidelines interesting personalities, events and mini plots threads at the expense of the fan service with a blink and you miss ending that sets up further entries."
ID_100206	The amount of negative reviews that are out there are simply hilarious. What were the mom's basement trolls looking for in the movie, a complete exposition of the 30 years that have passed since Return of the Jedi? If you were expecting that, then we would have a 9 hour plus movie.In this latest installment history always repeats itself, with the adage if it did work the last time then lets build a bigger one. Only to find out that it will only fail. Remember that this is the start of the 3rd trilogy, and the introduction of new characters, plots and worlds must take place in the first act, if you don't, then you will not know what's going on in all the other installments!Solid script, direction, story, production and especially the soundtrack. It is easier to be negative than to be positive and those that write negative reviews are only looking for their 15 minutes of 'fame'This movie is perfect, end of story. 5/5 stars
ID_100207	Watched the movie twice.I really tried to like it and find something at least half great as the advertising campaign behind it.The story might keep you interested although it's a recycled one.Its connections and references to the old movies take the spotlight in front of the narration.Sadly, this movie is not about its story.It's about its characters. Sadly(again), its characters are very weak in their construction.I understand that some of them can have a weak back story,or no back story at all but when you have a movie like this one on your hands though,you need to treat your characters with more respect.And your audience.Some of us are not willing to wait for another movie to find out who are they. No glimpse of their past,their motivation or purpose.Everything the two main characters do is forced out of their nature and context.The only one that is believable is the antagonist. He is the only one that has a clear reason to be in this movie and he seems quite determined to show it. He gets his motivation from Vader, whom he admires and reaches out to. We don't know all of his back story, but we understand that he was not like that from the beginning.You won't get an explanation for the strange light-saber from the trailer though.I'm sure everybody likes the music from Star Wars.I was glad to find out they got the same John Williams to do the soundtrack.In the theater I was disappointed to hear music on 85% of the movie.Excess is a trademark of bad taste.The music is very good, but it was too much for me and it had an unexpected effect.During one battle on a planet, there is no music.The sound design from that sequence might not be that bad, but when you play music from frame one till the end and leave a moment like that not covered by Williams,that moment seems much more weaker and the sound design really poor. I understood why they did it that way.It marks a moment when a character sees the other(at least for a long time), but doing it like this shows that Jar-Jar Abrams is a mediocre film school student director at best. There are more appealing ways to treat a moment like that one.He chose the least creative one and the safest way.Overall the movie is a safe-bet.People will like it although it's not groundbreaking.It's not even going in a slightly different direction.Star Wars has some good moments.I won't take those away from the movie.I enjoyed the action sequences.Fast paced editing, lots of tension and twists.They seem a bit singular in the whole context but they worked.The thing that bugged me were the jokes...the Disney Effect.I did not feel in the mood for small humor in a Star Wars movie.Han Solo made jokes in the old movies,but it was part of his character.Here, everybody has a small moment of cheap humor.Instant turn off.I don't know what I expected from a Star Wars movie directed by Abrams(several of his trademarks are here).I don't like his movies,and I'm sure that whatever I wanted from this movie, I did not get it.Just don't expect to see a masterpiece.
ID_100208	"Never understood why the new Star Wars trilogy got so much hate from the fandom, but after I rewatched all previous chapters (including Rogue One), I can understand why people that follows this saga since the beginning were so hard with it.First of all, the main villain is not credible at all. Beating Darth Vater for charisma is impossible, he will always be one of the best villain in cinema, but screenwriters could come up with something better than a crying kid that does not know what he wants. I never felt scared by Kylo Ren, and the overall interpretation is awful. Adam Driver, which a really good actor, does what he can, but I think that the main issue is on how the character was developed in the first place on the screenplay.We know since the beginning that a new order is risen from the ashes of the old empire, but during the movie there are too many missing information. You cannot really understand how this new dark side originated, where some important characters come from. Everything is very confusing and even if I have watched the entire saga, it feels like I have skipped a chapter of Star Wars.The movie is way too long, and filled with useless scenes. Too much cringey humor, Disney is very good to create ""comedic"" moments where is not needed. CGI is good, nothing to say, but this does not compensate the overall disappointment. They should have ended the saga with Episode VI."
ID_100209	Star Wars: The Force Awakens (2015) *** (out of 4) I'm pretty sure every person on Earth know what the film is about and just in case you don't I'm not going to spoil anything here in regards to the plot. Yes, it's basically a reworking of A NEW HOPE with the old and new characters being brought together to go up against the Dark Side.STAR WARS: THE FORCE AWAKENS was probably the most anticipated movie in recent memory and as no shocked it turned out to be a massive hit. I predicted when I heard that it was going to be made that it would eventually become the top grossing movie ever made. It hasn't quite reached that mark as of me writing this but I'm sure it will happen. So, we know it was a massive hit but how was the actual movie? I'm not a major STAR WARS fan but this one here isn't nearly as good as episodes four through six. How could it be? With that said I must admit that I found the film to be extremely entertaining, which is all I was personally asking for. I thought J.J. Abrams did a very good job at building up the new characters and the new story while also keeping the original trilogy fans happy. I thought the screenplay was clever in how the old characters were brought into this new story and I won't complain about any of the events that happen in regards to the story.The special effects, as you'd expect, are spectacular and they certainly push the level in regards to what can be done today. The various space battles were tremendous to look at and best of all is that they feel 100% authentic and real. There wasn't a single battle where you didn't feel as if you were right there in the action and this is always a major plus. Another thing are that the robotic characters are all well-designed and manage to fit right in with the series. The film is full of wonderful action scenes and all of them are full of terrific atmosphere.Performance wise, against I'm not going to spoil anything major so all I will say is that the original three actors are all excellent in how they are used. The new people like Daisy Ridley, JOhn Boyega, Oscar Isaac and Adam Driver all are good and I think fans have a nice cast to take this series into the future. Of course, we also have Chewbacca back, which is always fun.The film does have some flaws and I think some of it is based around the humor. The film goes for a lot of humor and I thought a lot of it didn't work all that well. Ford and Chewbacca get some nice moments together but many times the jokes fell flat. I'd also say that the film ran on a tad bit too long but the ending was so wonderful that it was fun once it came. STAR WARS: THE FORCE AWAKENS is really just a set-up for what's to follow and it certainly has me excited for what comes next.
ID_100210	"Let me start by saying: Wow! J.J. Abrams did it again! Like Star Trek before it, Star Wars is ready to take old and new generations of fans on a new journey. This is probably THE Star Wars movie that most people have waited for since Return of the Jedi. But I have to be frank: I liked the prequels. Don't hold it against me. They have their fans, despite what some say and think. It was George Lucas' attempt to show the bigger picture, the politics of this Galaxy Far Far Away; how it not only revolved around the actions of a few individuals but entire populations and governments. And most importantly, how it could have become an evil Empire. At the very least it enabled us to look at the original films and Darth Vader from another perspective. Unfortunately, the depiction of that era took away a bit of the rugged, dirty and lived in environments and the small, personal storyline that hallmarked the old trilogy. And let's be clear: it is hard to make prequels very surprising and fresh, since we know how they end. Even Peter Jackson had to find that out the hard way.But, that said, I am very pleased to say that the old feeling is back in full Force. J.J. Abrams always said that he wanted to make a successor in the spirit of the old trilogy, and he succeeded. From Lost, Star Trek, Cloverfield and Super 8, we know how J.J. Abrams is a master in taking old and familiar elements and putting them back together in surprisingly fresh ways, which is exactly what he did here. We are back to a story of exploration, where unassuming heroes venture into unfamiliar territory, the same elements that made the original trilogy so exiting. Fans will be pleased that the road is paved with familiar sights, old friends, and dark, ominous locations which seem far removed from the clean look of the prequels. Politics are conspicuously left out, and the threat of danger is tangible throughout the movie. And a great cast of not-too-well-known actors understands the B- movie nature of the movie without overdoing it (somethings the prequels were notorious for, I'll admit).If I have to make one obvious point of criticism, it is that it may all feel a bit too familiar. In approaching the old atmosphere and plotting of the original Star Wars, the makers have spared no expense to hint, nod, wink, reference and pay homage to their favorite episodes. The prequels dared to take risks and got into directions that alienated a lot of fans. This episode is playing it much more safe, perhaps a bit too much. If I had a checklist, my guess would be that half the scenes contain a direct reference or re-used plot point from earlier in the series (some more blatant than others). The hardcore fans are guaranteed a nerdgasm virtually every 5 minutes, which explains the extremely favorable first reactions to the movie. At certain points it just becomes a bit too obvious that they want to remind us how cool they are by trying to imitate the cool kids. But, in all fairness, in the key scenes, it works just fine. There are unforgettable moments that make great use of the previously established legacy that is Star Wars, such as the chillingly solemn epilogue. And they haven't forgotten to bring it with a light touch (leave it to Han Solo and his hairy sidekick!). Some of the crowd-pleasing moments had me laugh, some were so über-geeky that they made me think AND laugh, and others made me cheer like a 9-year-old. And in the truly unique scenes, they manage to find a beating heart in the story, remind us of all the great moments that came before, and present things to keep us guessing for what is to come. This movie is a good continuation, a great stand-alone movie, as well as a promise for what is to come. Past, present and future well balanced. Can't wait for Episode VIII!"
