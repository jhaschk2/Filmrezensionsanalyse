ID_100271	It's an awesome time to be alive when your life co-exists at a time when 'Star Wars' ruled the cinema screens. This is the film I was looking for. Being reunited with some old friends brought a nostalgic smile to my face as I returned to a time long ago, in a galaxy far, far away. It was simply coming home for this 'Star Wars' fanatic. Before I even thought about reviewing this latest installment, 'The Force Awakens', I had to see a viewing not once but twice. The first was out of pure excitement and after allowing my brain to process what I had just seen, I took a quick trip to the local cinema and relive the magic all over again.J.J. Abrams has to be commended for taking on this massive task. The self confessed fan knows exactly what 'Star Wars' means to the countless souls throughout the world but in saying this, the man is a professional and does get paid the big bucks. What Abrams has done well is instantly transporting the audience back to galactic worlds where the forces of good and evil are played out in an eternal struggle for supremacy. Against the backdrop of wonderful galactic arenas and timeless characters it doesn't take long for the audience to know that they are watching something uniquely 'Star Wars'. J.J has introduced new characters to drive the fresh direction of the space saga but is still respectful of the past by casting familiar faces that have made the 'Star Wars' epic so special. Abrams experience with the rebooted 'Star Trek' series has given him the knowledge and wisdom to recreate an epic universe and recognise the importance of George Lucas's story.'The Force Awakens' begins thirty years after the events of 'Return of the Jedi'. A map containing the whereabouts of the legendary Jedi Knight, Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), is placed into a BB8 droid by a resistance fighter named Poe Dameron (Oscar Issacs) before he is captured by the New Order led by the evil Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) who possesses the power of the force. And so the episode begins and it isn't long before we are introduced to Finn (John Boyega) and Rey (Daisy Ridley) who cross paths with each other on the junkyard planet of Jakku. They are forced to escape the planet with the BB8 droid after being tracked by the enemy and it is here that they fortuitously run into Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew). Together, they all set about returning the droid back to the Resistance before the New Order can intercept them. The Millennium Falcon races across the galaxy where General Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher) awaits the precious cargo. Absolutely brilliant stuff!The new cast of Ridley, Boyega, Issacs and Driver drive this new trilogy for a new generation. Each have created their own piece of history in the 'Star Wars' saga and need to continue to grow in the roles that they have created just as the original cast did before them. Daisy Ridley looks very comfortable in her starring role and doesn't seem overwhelmed by the magnitude of the narrative. Ridley works well with John Boyega with each increasingly familiar in the others presence. Harrison Ford is prominent throughout the film as his timeless character, Han Solo, effortlessly engaging with the younger cast members. Han's relationship with his lifelong mate, Chewbacca, oozes charm and is worth the price of admission alone. They truly are two of the greatest characters ever to grace the cinematic screen.J.J. Abrams has delivered an engrossing space fantasy that will satisfy the fans who have waited for the magic to one day return. He has been respectful to George Lucas's story but has had enough vision to open up avenues that the rest of the trilogy must explore. With the baton being past to a new Director for the next installment, the final trilogy has the potential for greatness. It is calling to us all.
ID_100272	The story looks like they wrote it in a day they took the same idea as before and to get the fans back they though in the old cast. Each shot was cut down to the minimum typical Attention defect disorder public can keep their attention. It jumps from one scene to another with minimal dialogue just enough to follow the story. The acting is horrible in some scenes. I hate JJ Abrams movies his style is nothing more then computer aided action blasted at you every few seconds. He cuts the scene down so bad the actors say a few words then cut say a few words cut. George Lucas should have left it alone and never sold it as much as I didn't like his last 2 Star Wars he made this is 100 times worse then anything George Lucas ever made. I'm so glad I never went to the movies to see this I suspected it was bad.
ID_100273	First of all, I don't know why there are people really bashing this movie. It is actually very good. I am already a fan since 1977, when the first...or better said, the fourth episode was released. And now, 32 years after episode VI, there is finally the continuation...sort of. No more Empire. Now there is the New Order. The interesting thing is that the 32 years that passed since episode VI, is also the time that passed in the story. Leia and Han have a son who appears in the story. I won't tell who or what he is... You should see this for yourself. Unlike episode I where an idiot figure like Jar Jar Binks appeared, speaking a ridiculous English, there is a nice new robot, named BB- 8. In short, I loved the movie, the action, the effects, and let's not forget the awesome 3D. Definitely worth watching...more than once. :)
ID_100274	"Only people that ""think"" they are fans are giving this movie negative reviews. This movie is absolutely incredible and I don't think anyone could have done any better with it. If your nit picking little things you should really re-think your entire view. This was probably one of the hardest movies ever to remake and JJ Abrams did an awesome job. He had a lot to live up to, and a lot to follow up.....and he did it!!For those of you bashing any of the story lines.. if you had the slightest idea of what you were talking about you would know George Lucas already had Most of this story written, and J.J. followed most of it. So complaining about the story is silly. You should sit back and enjoy the movie and appreciate you were given the opportunity in time to view it. So stop picking things apart and enjoy this movie, I saw it last night and cannot wait to see it again in a few hours!"
ID_100275	I still stand by the idea that this movie is awesome. It's a great return to form after the mess that is the prequel trilogy. It's unfortunate that the following movies make a lot of this one dumb in retrospect.
ID_100276	"I'll start by saying I have been a Star Wars fan for as long as I can remember. I remember back to when I was 3 and watching the movies non stop, playing with my Star Wars Lego, action figures, lightsabers and costumes made by my mum and always loving every second of it. I'm a fan of many franchises from Marvel to DC to Doctor Who but the biggest fandom of all has always been Star Wars. I may not have been around when the original movies were released but I am honestly one of the biggest Star Wars fans in the world.When I read online that Disney had bought Lucas Film and announced a third trilogy, I was mad excited, constantly wondering what it would be about and laughing at the fact George Lucas said in an old behind the scenes feature, without any hesitation, that there would never be an Episode 7. Ever since September 2012, I have been eagerly awaiting this new installment. incredibly excited at the release of every new trailer and then the moment finally came where I would watch the movie for the first time. I didn't know the plot, I avoided all the spoilers I could and when I saw it, my mind was blown up like a Deathstar. The movie was everything I'd hoped for. Thankfully, nothing was spoiled for me. JJ Abrams who directed the Star Trek films which are some of my top favourites along with the writer of The Empire Strikes Back and Raiders of the Lost Ark, made a film I loved every second of. It felt great to have Star Wars back again. I had the most fun I've ever had watching a movie before and I'm not just saying that. I've given it a few days to sink in, I've seen it three times and my thoughts are still the same. Although I'm sorry to see on IMDb so many of the common reviews are the negative ones. People are saying this movie is a reboot of A New Hope (even though the original cast is obviously in it) but they also say this because the story is similar. I understand their points but they've blown it way out of proportion. For example, yes there is Star Killer base which is basically another Death Star, yes Kylo Ren is a strong, evil and memorable villain like Darth Vader, yes Rey is from a desert planet like Luke and put there for reasons unknown at the time but I didn't see the First Order take over a Resistance ship and kidnap Poe before he gave information to BB8 who went in an escape pod and was bought by Rey's Uncle Owen to later meet an old jedi who took Rey and BB8 with him on board a smuggler's ship to deliver BB8 to a planet destroyed by Star Killer base to wind up on the base, saving Poe, escaping, losing the Old Jedi to Kylo Ren so Rey can come back on an x-wing to blow up Star Killer base. I didn't see any of that. It's less similar to A New Hope than people say. A New Hope was the seed of the franchise so all films are a root grown from the seed, they all have their similarities. In fact, Star Wars has always been about an unlikely hero destined to become something greater to help the forces of good to stop an evil army. This movie is a new generation of that which is exactly what the fans said they want. So don't be fooled by people who say it's another A New Hope. But then again, you can't argue with the fanboys because one minute the prequels are too different and now The Force Awakens is too similar. Of course you just can't please everyone but don't be fooled into thinking this movie is everything the haters say it is. I'm a die hard fan and I love Star Wars: The Force Awakens. I love the acting from everyone especially the phenomenal Daisy Ridley, I loved all the characters, especially Kylo Ren, the very evil villain you love to hate, who I had bought posters, costumes and toys of months prior to seeing the movie, I loved the story, the humour and the directing. I loved the combination of practical and CGI effects. BB8 is not only believable because he's a practical prop, but he is an adorable character and always fun to watch. It felt like Star Wars and I loved it. I could have only wished to see a little more of Captain Phasma, R2, C3PO, Leia and the new Starkiller base but other than that, I loved this movie and I cannot wait to buy it on BluRay and I cannot wait for Episode VIII coming out in 2017. I am not sugar coating, I loved this movie. I give, without any hesitation, Star Wars: The Force Awakens a 10/10. I do believe this is my favourite Star Wars film of all time so far. As I said in my YouTube video blog, ""If you're a Star Wars fan, you'll love this movie and if you see this movie and you hate it, you are not a Star Wars fan."" Haha!"
ID_100277	The time has finally come, a new star wars film has arrived. A sequel to the original trilogy and hopefully an apology for the 3 prequels. Also now in the hands of Disney who have had the rights to star wars at the parks for years. Seemed like a good move and honestly I think it was a wise choice. I shuddered when I heard JJ Abrams was the chosen director. I find him over- rated and personally dummbed down star trek and ruined it completely for a new generation. However I was still excited and would give him the benefit of the doubt. So how does the new movie fair?.......well it basically has the exact same plot as A New Hope with old and new characters thrown into the mix. All in all the movie was not terrible but it felt like they wanted to play it too safe and rely on nostalgia to convince movie goers that star wars is back. Watching it I couldn't help but fall back in love because of this nostalgia however that being said upon analization of the film afterwards proved to remove the beer goggles.As stated before this is a re-has of a new hope. There is another death star, a new disappointing villain, however he may grow into a badass but for now is weak and pathetic. The pacing was also terrible and everything happened to fast and relies on previous knowledge. For fans coming into this film without seeing previous movies may ask themselves, this is what the hype was all about?That being said it was hard to hate on this film, because they did try but were not wanting to take a gamble and branch out into a complete new storyline with risks. I'm curious to see what direction this goes however I'm scared as the next director hired is the gentleman who bastardised jurrasic world. In my personal oppion I'd give this a 7 however rating this as a film not as a fan it would get a soft 6.
ID_100278	"Being a fan of the original Star Wars films, and then having the franchise all but ruin it with I, II, and III, I had high expectations with this film. But with J.J. Abrams and Disney, they came in swinging, and hit a home run. The story line goes back to the basics of what made the original excellent! It had an ""old Star Wars"" feel from the beginning, and that was just perfect! We saw old friends, and met new ones. There were twists, moments revealed, moments of shock, moments of cheering. The writing was excellent and I thought they played the story out well enough to give you enough of a taste to fill your empty Star Wars stomach. At the end of the movie I wanted to jump up for joy - but as it was the entire audience cheered, and whooped, and fell in love with Star Wars all over again. Well done JJ Abrams and Disney....well done! I'll be seeing it again VERY soon."
ID_100279	JJ did a great job. Especial effects look great. This movie takes you back to the style of the first 3 movies. Less digital, more realistic. I liked that a lot.The problem is the story.When you watch the movie you already seen all of that in the first movie of George Lucas (ep IV). They remix the characters, the landscape change, but what happens in the story is basically all very alike the first movie.There is no new ideas on how to continue the story, so they scrambled and gave it again.Another problem is the lack of dept of the characters. Princess Leia wasn't amazing in the first movies, but really has nothing special to bring in this movie. The new pretty face of the movie does an awesome job, but the story doesn't help her, and makes her do some not believable things for those how know the SW universe.Is still a good movie to watch, but again, not something that gets the SW fans satisfied.If only the story was as good as the special effects...PS. The new dark lord. Bad, really bad. PS2. A good thing: You would never say this is a Disney movie!
ID_100280	Possibly the most incompetent script ever written for a major motion picture sequel. It's completely wrong to call it a rip-off of Star Wars - it only steals the message-in-a-droid idea and then just goes into a morass of pointless coincidence and plotless sequences until they decide to blow up the Death Planet at which point the story much more closely resembles Return of the Jedi - right down to the father/son confrontation intercut with the fighter attack. The new characters are however quite lovable and they honestly deserved a better story. There are way too many unexplained introductions of icons from the original trilogy (Why is the Falcon there? How did she get Luke's lightsaber?) and it just seems like the filmmakers couldn't be bothered figuring out how to make it all make sense and just gave up.
ID_100281	This franchise does not need to be defended by anyone. It exists as a juggernaut of franchises and cannot and will not be stopped. The Force Awakens is a spectacular entry in the Star Wars franchise. I take issue with anyone who finds nothing in this entry to enjoy. It literally is a joy to watch from beginning to end. It brings back just about every feeling you could want in a sequel of this nature. The original cast members that return are quite simply Star Wars royalty and all do their jobs excellently. Ford steals the movie as Solo in a performance that will be legendary. The new cast's in Ridley, Boyega, Gleeson, Driver and Isaac are all home runs and they did a great job of laying the ground work for future episodes. The force is strong again... and Star Wars is back in every way possible. Great job by all involved.
ID_100282	I know it's popular online to trash the Disney trilogy, and I agree with some of the hate that Last Jedi and Rise of Skywalker gets, but this movie doesn't deserve any of the hate it gets, in my opinion. This movie was fantastic, if you ask me. It had some very good and likable characters, a nice story, and a very good villain in Kylo Ren. And I think this is movie fed off the original trilogy in the best and most enjoyable way possible.8.7/10.
ID_100283	"Star Wars: The Force Awakens is a fabulous film and is a good dose of escapism from mundane everyday life, just like The Original Trilogy was. We can forget all our problems when seeing this movie. The Force Awakens sparks a joy for the child in all of us which many of us have been waiting for since The Empire strikes Back or Return of the Jedi. There couldn't have been a story more worthy of the subtitle 'Episode VII'.I will say that though the film is derivative of the other Star Wars films at times, it uses the tropes to the benefit of the story rather than detract from it, like the whole Trade Negotiations rubbish that plagued the Star Wars Prequel Trilogy. J.J. Abrams reinvigorates the assaulted franchise and gives us some of the most powerful moments ever seen in the saga.Don't give in to the trolling of the 'prequel fanboys'. They're just upset that somebody did a much stronger job than Lucas could have managed on his own. They couldn't tell a good movie apart from Transformers 3 & 4, or any Michael Bay movie for that matter. We are entitled to our own opinion and mustn't succumb to these 'emotion vampires' that do their best and ultimately fail to make a difference in the end.The Force Awakens is a refreshingly fun film that as a form of escape in this day and age plagued by terrorism, cyber-terrorism, LGBT discrimination and racism. Star Wars is a welcoming series that isn't conformed by anything in our world ; it's a self-realising ecstasy that will always be there for us like an old friend.Edit: While I do still love this film I do not dismiss the fact that some people did not like the film very much. What I do dismiss is their dismissal of anyone liking it or disliking it unsubjectively. We're our own persons and not 'sheeple'. The Force Awakens is just a film, and let's agree to disagree and not spit venom at each other for it, okay? I know that it's not totally original but it didn't need to be. I loved this movie for what it IS, not for what it isn't. There; I've said what I needed to be addressed."
ID_100284	Star Wars: The Force Awakens was a copy of A New Hope , using a similar plot and plot points of the original Star Wars film. This is hardly a new revelation: critics and fans made that point when it was first released. The plan was to make an entertaining if safe film to win back fans who displeased with the Prequel. The Force Awakens manages this with ease: it was a fun, popcorn film with excellent special effects and action sequences. When compared to J. J. Abrams' Star Wars work Rise of Skywalker, The Force Awakens actually had some build-up and invested in the characters.
ID_100285	"With the upcoming release of ""Star Wars: The Last Jedi"" i've decided to make a review of this movie.
""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" is a movie directed by J.J. Abrams and stars Daisy Ridley, Adam Driver, John Boyega, Oscar Isaac, Harrison Ford, and many more. This movie takes place after ""Return of the jedi"" back in 1983 and is about the resistance has to complete a very important mission for the destiny of the galaxy and the first order has to stop it. 
Let's talk about the positive things, the visual effects are fantastic. J.J. is a director that is known for his ability to combine the CGI effects and the practical ones at just the right level, and it shows. By the way this is a very well directed movie and very well edited too. All this together with John Williams's score, you do feel like Star Wars is more than back into the big screen.
The performances in this movie are some of the best of the entire saga with out a dude. John Boyega as Finn is fantastic and Daisy Ridley is magnificent as Rey. She is easily the best part of this movie. Adam Driver was awesome as Kylo Ren, one of the best movie villains in recent years. Harrison Ford as Han Solo is very good, and the friendship between Han and Chewie still there and is very fresh.
This is a very funny movie, in my opinion this is the funniest movie of the entire saga. And almost all the comedy comes from BB-8, which is awesome and i loved it in this film.
""Episode VII"" has some very good battle sequences and the sound mixing was great, you feel the action almost directly in your face and is awesome to see.
The easter eggs and references to the other Star Wars movies were also great, and there are shown with respect to the saga and the fans of the source material. I like the fact that the references there are not in the entire movie, which i'm very happy. Because this movie had a danger to doing that like ""Jurassic World"" did it that year, but thanks to the force, that didn't happened.
I loved this movie,but it does have some flaws. For example, Snoke and Maz Kanata. This movie has this two CGI characters here, but they don't matter all that much. There are scenes when we see Snoke talking to some people and is not that interesting or important. The same thing happened with Maz, she was and old lady who sometimes talks about other Star Wars things, but is not interesting. But, don't worry, there are not in the entire movie.
This movie is one for my favorites movies of Star Wars and it is i the 4th place in my ranking of the Star Wars movies. I've already watched ""The Last Jedi"" and is amazing, but I need to watch it a second time before i do the review. Those are my thoughts of ""Star Wars: Episode VII"" and thats way i'm going to give it a 9/10."
ID_100286	"While this film is an improvement on some of the prequil movies such as Attack of the Clones, which were a disappointment, it lacks the soul and character the original 3 had.The plot was very vague and oversimplified and the character development was also lacking.However there were some great performances from Ridley and Boyega and of course Ford always delivers a good performance. It felt a little too much like a ""Disney"" film, although it was nice to see Carrie Fisher & Harrison Ford again. The movie feels too much like a Star Trek film and this is where Abram's influence shows. It was a mistake not to allow Lucas to direct. The movie did have its positive aspects and had great action and special effects. I think most fans are relieved that the movie didn't suck."
ID_100287	I was shocked and pleasantly surprised to see the overwhelming number of negative reviews here, expecting the Star Wars fans to heap grandiose praises on it. There is little original here. The pacing is better than the prequels, the score still gives chills, and the effects reflect some of the improvements of late and the 3D, but the plot and dialogue is SO simplistic, and the movies length is out of proportion to the story itself, which is mostly a rehash of the original triad, updated. While there is no vulgarity, the dialogue is still aimed mainly at the middle school level, and the violence, while sanitized, is prevalent throughout. For die-hard fans, negative reviews will have no effect, but if you are not in that category, you aren't missing much if you miss this.
ID_100288	I find it absolutely sickening that I paid $15 for this crap. I went there with my g/f and halfway through it we had to leave because it was getting too painful to continue to watch. The theater was nearly full and there was a lot of nervous tension going around and when the opening script started to appear there was a huge round of cheers and my g/f lost by telling folks to quiet down because it was rude. The cheers lasted awhile and most of couldn't here the initial dialogue. The sad part was most folks were clueless on who the actual characters were and didn't understand when older characters appeared. I had to tell the d'bags next to me to shut-up because I didn't want to hear them anymore or the stupidity coming from their mouth. I doubt after this epic failure there will be another episode, with this crap Star Wars is pretty much dead and buried.
ID_100289	"Star Wars VII: The Force Awakens (2015) -I really can't see why so many critics/so called ""Fans"" have such a beef with this film. Okay, so its promises weren't totally fulfilled in its two sequels, but this film delivered a new fresh take on the classic tale that we have always loved.It did rehash a lot of what had gone before, with a lost youth abandoned on a desert planet who was plunged in to being a part of the rebellion and even the outcome of this instalment was similar to that of Episode's IV (1977) and VI (1983) and some might also argue that Episode I (1999) had done exactly the same thing.But the symmetry and the repetition has always been a part of what I've liked about Star Wars. It has a ""Balance"" throughout and in fairness, these situations are likely to be true. When one merciless Empire is destroyed, another would likely rise from its ashes to keep the fight going and probably follow a lot of the same ideas of how to go about it all, building bigger and more powerful space stations that can cause more and more damage and the rebels would always rise up again to bring them down.Not only that but this film brought the fan's favourite franchise to a brand new audience, which only achieved even more longevity for the series that I have enjoyed for so long. A new generation could appreciate the modern touches that they might have found missing from the other six films that preceded it.There was action. It had adventure. It had romance and it had humour, there wasn't much more that I could need, except perhaps Poe (Oscar Isaac) and Finn/FN-2187 (John Boyega) in a compromising and naked clinch?Although some of the actors were a bit new, none of them really gave a bad performance and the more that I rewatch this one the more that I think that Domhnall Gleeson's weak General Hux character was more about the character actually being a snivelling toad than about the actor doing it badly and even Kylo Ren, played by Adam Driver was giving a good version of a wayward teenager gone astray and rebelling against his parents in a childish way. After all I wasn't supposed to like their personalities anyway.It was clear that Oscar Isaac as Poe was meant to take the action hero strain from Harrison Ford's Han Solo, who couldn't quite fight like he used to and obviously John Boyega's character of Finn and Rey, played by Daisy Ridley were the options to take the mantle of the latest Jedi, but which one?That just left a vacancy for someone to fill Carrie Fisher's role of Princess/General Leia Organa. Although she was still present in the storyline, someone had to take over her more feisty Princess responsibilities, so again it was a toss up between Finn and Rey. Ultimately I liked the decisions that they made and the way that the old generation was bridged to the new and actually the various traits from the older cast were actually spread around amongst the new and not swapped like for like entirely.BB-8 (Brian Herring & Dave Chapman) made another great addition as the roly-poly sphere droid, despite R2-D2 (??) and C-3PO (Antony Daniels) being available and perhaps that update was a refresh that was needed, with the general humour being spread throughout the cast rather than being mostly reserved for 3PO's old mother-like behaviour and R2's witty one liners.I also really liked the introduction of Maz Kanata (Lupita Nyong'o) and I was hoping to find out how she recovered Luke's lightsaber in one of the follow up films, but she was never used properly again sadly. I also wanted to know what Max Von Sydow's character, Lor San Tekka, felt so guilty about and how he had come to obtain the map that the whole story centred around.The other thing that I needed to know was where Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis) had originated from and how he came to have power over Kylo and The First Order. The rumour that he was the stormtrooper that banged its head in Episode IV: A New Hope, seemed a bit of a stretch just because of the scar on his head and I find it highly unlikely that his more recent character Kino Loy from 'Andor' (2022) was so upset about being left behind that he rose in power to lead the First Order.The First Order was born of the aftermath of the evil Empire and once again it was a small pocket of resistance that were determined to bring justice back to the galaxy. I personally thought that this team did a great job of establishing that and J. J. Abrams did a great job at relaunching the franchise as he had done with 'Star Trek' (2009). I just wish that he'd stayed to see it through for the films that followed on both counts, but this one was awesome.932.11/1000."
ID_100290	Quickie Review:The Galactic Empire has fallen, but thirty years later from its ashes rises a new threat to The Republic. A rag-tag group of heroes and resistance fighters must come together to face The First Order and the dangerous new weapon they've built. Meanwhile, the mysterious figure known as Kylo Ren is on a mission to finish the journey to the dark side, following his idol Darth Vader. Star Wars TFA, is not perfect but it is the film the fans have been aching for. The focus is back on the characters and their relations, set in the grand operatic setting of Star Wars. Familiar heroes are back to bring out your nostalgia but more importantly the new cast make an impactful impression, leaving you excited to see more of them in the future films. TFA does traverse some familiar plots from the original story but sets the stage for exciting adventures ahead without sacrificing the thrill of this film. If you aren't one of the millions already seen the film in the first weekend, make sure you aren't missing out soon.Full Review:At work I've seemed to have built up a reputation of being a rabid fan of Star Wars. Though that's true, I am a huge fan of the franchise, the fandom all over the world goes far beyond. Considering the hate towards the prequels, many fans including myself had their hopes riding on TFA. Thankfully, the movie was able to re-capture the magic of the original Star Wars.While we do see some of our favourite characters returning, the focus of the movie is truly on the new cast. First of all, the two leading heroes Rey (Daisy Ridley) and Finn (Jon Boyega) are instantly likable. These are not the one note characters of the prequels, they are layered and have growth that feels natural. Their charming personalities had me invested in the perils they are thrusted into. On the darker end, we have Kylo Ren so wonderfully portrayed by Adam Driver. He deserves the honour of being a great addition to Star Wars hall of villainy. In just one film I got to know so much about his conflicts and ambitions. Yet at the same time there is still a veil of mystery on the character, an intrigue behind him that I can't wait to see be explored more in the later films. We also get to see more characters from the original trilogy, the highlight of which was Han Solo. At no point did it feel like he was just playing this role again for some easy cash. He was right at home playing Han which made it all the more fun for me to watch him return to this beloved franchise. Other recognisable icons are used in a smart way, with moderation as to not grab the attention away from the story.Aside from the great cast, I enjoyed the way the film was shot. One of the biggest point of their marketing was the use of practical effects, and it pays off. I will make the claim now, this film will age much better than the prequels, because everything feels authentic and tangible. The practical effects brought a sense of realism to the fantasy of this world. The action scenes were beautifully shot with all the dogfights and gunfights getting your blood pumping. On top of that I loved the light sabre fights. There are no fancy CGI jumps and twirls, instead it was a messy fight for survival, driven purely by rage and fear. These weren't scenes for just spectacle but ones that furthered the growth of the characters involved, a critical moment in their journey with the Force. I'd like to say more about some scenes that I feel will become iconic in the future but I will leave that for you to experience.Though I loved the film, it is not perfect. The main issue it comes down to is the fact there are too many similar story points in TFA borrowed directly from the original trilogy. So for the most part the movie plays it quite safe. At the same time my main complain of the prequels was that they don't feel like a Star Wars adventure. However, TFA does capture that sense of magic and adventure of Star Wars, so in a way borrowing the story elements did help. Moving forwards I'd like to see newer ideas come into play but that's something to discuss in 1.5 years from now (let the countdown begin for Episode 8!).Again if you aren't one of the millions who have rushed out to see it, don't wait too long. Go now and experience what we've always loved about Star Wars, great heroes, great villains, great action, and great mythology. Star Wars The Force Awakens gives me confidence in the future of this franchise.
ID_100291	I know, I know, Please don't kill me, although I see that some of you agree.I will say this, I actually loved the new characters that were made for this generation of Star Wars. Fin acts a lot like a Star Wars fan trapped in a Star Wars movie and his origin was pretty cool. His chemistry with Rey was dynamic and to be blunt, it's good to see a strong female character in a Star Wars movie other than Princess Leia(who I loved in this movie as well). Poe Dameron was a great character as well. He looks like a carbon copy of Hon Solo and that would have been the case if it were played by anyone one else other than Oscar Issac. I even like Adam Driver as the Dark warrior Kylo Ren. I could go on and on with the many supporting characters, but I won't. Let's just say they all were developed well from the biggest to the trivial.And speaking of Trivial, the attention to detail was amazing. It was not just quick scenes in the movie that would make Star Wars fans eyebrows raise when they realize the Easter egg they caught, but it looks like they add cool stuff that would make new fans go ga ga twenty years from now. And the movie has an very epic appeal to it, as a good Star Wars movie should. the Visual effects are as stunning as the original trilogy. Now here's the problem. The movie is not tight enough. I went into the film trilled at the fact that it was only going to be 16 mins over two hours instead of taking up half my day, but in reality this movie could have been two hours flat. Number seven had a lot of cool images but a lot of it dragged on a minute too long in an attempt to get dramatic effect.And that's the other thing. All the images were cool, but I felt no emotion in it, and that's an important factor with the Force Awakens. a lot of stuff is going to happen that's suppose to make you tear up and suppose to make you clap for joy, but the only parts that connected with me emotionally were the parts that made me laugh. I noticed a lot of those fun moments were when the movie was poking fun at the franchise, which is easy to do, while the other emotions are not.Bottom line, JJ Abrams' reboot of the Star Trek franchise was far better than his sequel to Star Wars. Everything he did that made me love that movie only made the Force Awakens OK. Something tells me this whole new trilogy will just be OK if I go by episode seven.
ID_100292	Well, where do I begin? Star Wars were great, then they started to die with each new episode. Then came this one abomination of desolation of our eyes and brains. What is wrong here - to omit all the mentioned already faults - absolutely wrong and unnecessary amount of silly jokes and vapid humor which leave much to be desired and ruins the solemnity of the film. Are we glad to see old Han Solo and Lea? Nay, they are as old as hills and simply drag by. Chewbacca? Same old geezer. Luke? One second. Not much to persuade us to like this sad, slow, long and unnecessary installment. Then the bad guy comes. Og my, who told him to utter his lines in this unimaginably awful flat bleak whining voice? Is he scary? Never a chance. He is merely a buffoon hidden in a mighty shadow of Lord Darth. And this new bad guy on a throne? Come on, give me a break. All said, we must admit that he sound is crisp, the camera work is serene, the editing is awesome. Well, this is all. Then you watch this and hate this.
ID_100293	"The latest addition to the Star Wars stable of films, The Force Awakens, recalls the first film made way back in 1977. There's a hero who is unaware of her Jedi powers, a new, bigger Death Star and and a villain who shares the same lineage as Darth Vader and wants to be like him. This film is not really doing anything, in other words, that has not already been done. Moreover, the original achieved what it did with more class and flair. The villain in this film lacks the presence and menace, of Darth Vader. The hero comes across as a rather desperate re-run of Luke Skywalker, whilst, ""super sizing"" a Death Star doesn't change the fact its still, well, a Death Star. Reintroducing some classic Star Wars actors and characters, aside from the obvious nostalgia factor, does little to lift this film either. The result is a rather ordinary flick, that is not bad, as such, but for those of us old enough to remember the original film, its not doing anything new either. Instead, The Force Awakens, looks more like a retread of a much better, earlier, envisioning from the Star Wars universe. Six out of ten from me."
ID_100294	"There's no time travelling in Star Wars, is there? No, didn't think so. Watching ""Episode 7: The Force Awakens"", however, the much anticipated 2015 continuation of the original trilogy, you would think you'd been thrown back to 1977 and were watching, in some alternate dimension, a re-run of the very first film itself. Sceptics have been writing for years on the 'place' Hollywood blockbusters have in the canon of film as an art-form, deriding them for being derivative, or for too often coming to form replications of each other, but this really does take the space-cake. The film is, in fact, so reminiscent in certain places of Episode IV that you might just as well call it An 'Old' Hope.The film begins with a mother-ship's silhouette blotting out a sun and the launch of a series of spaceships which head down to a nearby planet. The bigger ship, belonging to The First Order, which has risen out of the ashes of Darth Vader's old Evil Empire, in doing so infers a powerful ability to blot out or ruin anything it comes into contact with. Inside one of the smaller ships, the populous is cleverly introduced via some flickered lighting, which actually alludes to a later crisis of conscience one of the inhabitants will have. Once on the surface, they ambush a village with connections to the Resistance in looking for a piece of a map which will, apparently, direct them to the legendary Luke Skywalker, who, being the last Jedi, will win the war for the Dark once and for all if they find and kill him. At the last moment, a pilot called Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) hides the portion inside a small robot who escapes with it.Enter the protagonist, Rey (Daisy Ridley); a young-ish orphan, who should probably look grubbier and uglier, living on the same planet and who trades in scrap from crashed spaceships of the first war for portions of food. Her literal harvesting of these parts from old cruisers of the first three films is, in some ways, a reflection of how the film itself is taking from past efforts. Into her world ambles said droid and the map, and then later still the character of Finn (John Boyega), who is a storm trooper for the Dark but decides to change sides. Finn's introduction to the film, like Rey's, is a slow unsheathing of a mask or helmet to reveal the face in close-up, inferring a kind of duality or connection - sure enough, they spend the majority of the film together and become close allies.Dodging the incoming First Order, the two make off with one of the more famous pieces of Star Wars paraphernalia which they find lying around in the area, Rey demonstrating piloting skills you would have thought were beyond her without the ability to practise to any degree. After breaking down in outer space, they are caught up by two familiar faces in Chewbacca and Harrison Ford's Han Solo, who have become, in the years since the war, interstellar versions of long distance truckers. Their haul on this particular occasion are large man eating squid-like monsters. Do we think they'll escape and wreak havoc, or not? What do you think? The film then becomes somewhat of a race to rebel HQ, with the villains never too far from their tails. Later on, attention shifts to a weapon of mass destruction the First Order possess which, despite existing in the shadow of the old Empire, is ten times more powerful.The film is not a disaster by any means, but it leaves a lot to be desired. I think it probably attempts to cram too much in for it to feel like a work of real substance: the decision by a trooper to defect; a sub-plot to do with a father/son relationship; the foiling of an evil scheme; the rekindling of two old flames in Solo and a certain Princess. Its approach is too pulpy to take seriously; I felt its introduction of Rey and her lonely world, a stretch of film that is told visually without dialogue for a about two minutes, could have gone on for another ten, while its finale is similar to, but probably not as thrilling as, 1996's ""Independence Day"" with its final assault unfolding in conjunction with a dogfight.Then there is the issue of one particular cast member who had already said he didn't want to be a part of the franchise after this edition, so his character has been written out. This is sad for the fact we lose an old face, yes; but it also demeans the artistic pursuit of direction and damages the concept of auteurism. When decisions to take a project in particular direction are made by these means, and not by a creative vision, just what are we even left watching?Essentially, ""The Force Awakens"" is a re-treading of Lucas' initial 1977 effort: the message being hidden in a droid; the Vader-style villain in black turning up with his troopers looking for it; the young desert-dwelling hero bumping into it; the stumbling into an intergalactic adventure; the tracking shot through the Cantina-style bar, etc. What is new is not even necessarily new either: a post-Hunger Games style heroine and a post-Wall*E style droid hardly blow us away. For all the crowing on increased diversity, read Manthia Diawara's 1988 essay 'Black Spectatorship: Problems of Identification & Resistance' on black and white characters sharing the screen for problems linked to John Boyega's casting. Diawara's observations of things in ""48 Hours""; ""Beverly Hills Cop"" and ""Rocky II"" might just as well be applied here, particularly during the climactic lightsaber fight. What ""progress"" has even been made? In the end, JJ Abrams has created a decent actioner and provided us with the buzz of seeing some old faces, but nothing much else."
ID_100295	Great plot, great actors, everything is so amazing
ID_100296	Now we have to be honest, if you bought a franchise for 4 billion dollars: would you be bold and risk the longevity of the story for one good motion picture, or would you stick to what works and lay the foundation of an everlasting franchise?This is what the movie feels like: predetermined, characters must live as they lay the foundation of episode VIII and IX. There can not be any profound story twists that make it harder for future sequels. Everything is also very familiar, revisiting old plot lines. New characters are likable, but they feel like watered down versions of the original characters with the same story arcs. With less screen time and character development.There is also a strong presence of nostalgia, introducing the same artwork and design from the original trilogy. Also the introduction of SW veterans Luke, Leia and Han. Yet here their presence is poor and basically have no memorable scenes. I would go to the certain extent and say the screenwriters even took the liberty of being bold in such a bad manner with these characters. In many ways I feel they were just in it to secure the passing of the torch to the new generation.I am from the generation that actually watched prequel trilogy before watching the original one and by any means is not a SW fan. I did not experience the same SW hysteria when original was made. But I see a great divide here on IMDb, most people either hate it or love it. I think it has a great production value and had it been any other stand-alone science fiction, I would have given it an 8. I have a principle of trying to not judge a film by comparing it to others but rather on the basis of its genre. The movie is actually great fun and a well-crafted adventure. But it is built on an existing legacy. Star Wars exist and I can not ignore the fact that a lot of this movie is a blue print on the original trilogy. Good storytellers say they have drawn inspiration from other movies and created something original (ex. The Dark Knight is modeled after Heat, weird huh?). This movie pretends to do so, although here in SW Universe there is a direct link between the movies.Now, to my initial question: If I bought something for 4 billion dollars, heck I would not even dare touch it with a kilometer long stick. This is the mentality of this production and the current trajectory of mainstream movie-making. Hollywood rely on major franchises and peddle mostly on nostalgia, true originality is hard to come by these days. TFA is no exception.
ID_100297	I am coming from a place of honesty, and for some reason people just hate on other's opinions. Growing up with Star Wars since I was little, the franchise has held a special place in my heart. And as I grew up, I recognized there are flaws in both the original trilogy and the prequels.The sequels are by far no means perfect but that cannot take away from the love and dedication that a collaborative group of people made on screen in 2015. The Force Awakens might follow similar beats to the 1977 original but it is a film that truly captures the tone and hope that George Lucas created back 40 years prior.It seems cool now to hate Disney and what they did with this trilogy. Again, this is no perfect film and its sequels are not perfect either. But the rewatch-ability and the experience of seeing this film with multiple generations coming together in a theater will never be topped.The Force Awakens is not the best Star Wars movie but I think in a few years time... it will be looked on more fondly for the spark of excitement and wonder it created in the fandom upon first release.
ID_100298	"In 2005 I was in a massive, packed theater on opening day for ""Revenge of the Sith"", convinced it would be the final ""Star Wars"" movie. The mood was electric, the audience was buzzing with excitement and there were massive cheers and applause every time a new character appeared on screen. It was an incredible moment and one I was sure I'd never experience again.In 2015 I was in a massive, packed theater on opening day for ""The Force Awakens"". There was a smattering of applause at the beginning and end of the film and when the Falcon, Han Solo and Chewbacca first appear. There were also a few laughs for a couple of scenes. Other than that, silence. Walking out of the theater, surrounded by hundreds of moviegoers, no one uttered a word. Everyone just shuffled out in a deathly quiet.Now don't get me wrong, ""The Force Awakens"" is a fantastic movie and the best thing JJ Abrams has ever done. However it also underwhelmed me in a way Episodes I to III never did. There is enough good, even great in it, and I have enough good will towards the series to name it my favorite film of the year, but I also have major problems with it, which range from the outer packaging all the way to the creamy center.Everything you feared since hearing JJ Abrams was directing has come to pass (lens flares aside). His obsession with the first three films as well as ""real sets, practical effects"" is taken much too far. You can see everything coming from a mile away, none of the mysteries and twists work and there is zero emotional weight to the film. The endeavor also suffers from a major case of telling rather than showing and as such we are pleadingly being asked to love our new heroes rather than liking them of our own volition.Of the new characters, Snoke and Hux are great, Kylo Ren is the weakest villain the series has ever had, Captain Phasma is useless, Rey and Finn are fine, Poe Dameron makes no impression whatsoever and BB-8 is pretty cool but very redundant.Again it's a great film, and I'll see it again in theaters. Just be careful to keep your hype in check."
ID_100299	"not flawless, but still very, very good.what many negative reviews say is that its a ""remake"" rather than a sequel. it certainly seems that way, but it was definitely done that way for a reason: to appease star wars fanboys. you can see so much of a new hope in this movie that its crazy. but that isn't a bad thing. its just something that will cleanly divide viewers of this movie. some people love it, some people criticize it for being this way. personally, i think they went just a little overboard with the nostalgia, but they did what they originally planned to do: revitalize the series, try to remedy the damages done by the prequels, and start off what looks to be a great trilogy. this movie does a lot of setting up, with plot, characters, and even themes. rage is something i had never seen in a sith but it was always said throughout all of the star wars movies that it was a path to the dark side, and this movie really showed that. it also answered a lot of questions that people had coming into this movie.one thing i especially liked are the new characters. finn is very charismatic and rey is a strong independent woman, and they can be correlated with han and leia, but finn its as if they took some of hans qualities out of finn and plugged in some of Luke's original qualities in a new hope, and then did the same with some of the leia qualities in rey. overall, I'm really excited for these characters, and new ones to come (benicio del toro). also, I'm now a fan of Oscar isaac, and while his acting was questionable at times, he did a great job as a character who wasn't really based off of anybody.while we are on the topic of acting, i want to mention that abrams did a great job of taking these D-list actors and turning them into stars.the main reason i couldn't hate all of the correlations with a new hope is because, well, its star wars, and they copied great concepts from a great movie."
ID_100300	I saw it but my nieces and nephew were making so much noise that I couldn't concentrate
