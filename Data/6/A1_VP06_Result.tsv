ID_100151	10	The good news is you don't really need to watch the original Star Wars films in order to follow along with this film. But then honestly, why wouldn't you have seen the original Star Wars films? Star Wars is really an amazing franchise, starting in 1977 with the very first film. Can you imagine watching that in its inception? All these years later, you're still in awe of the characters, the story, the effects, the set pieces--the whole universe. The sets don't even look that different in this one than the ones from the '70s. Yet, we're still in awe.Without giving too much away, Star Wars: The Force Awakens revolves around the First Order (the dark side) trying to control the galaxy while racing against the Resistance (the light side) to find the disappeared Luke Skywalker. The film mixes old characters with a band of new characters--characters that you're going to love--and doesn't stray from what was so charismatic about the original movies.The film truly has that classic feel to it--from the scene cuts to the camera-work to the dialogue. This isn't your Marvel movie, folks. In fact, it makes us rethink what exactly we love about those films to begin with. I mean, we have Star Wars back now. What more could we want? But there is a different kind of levity brought here that we actually may be able to actually thank Marvel for. It's not too much, but the perfect amount. In the originals, they would have never dared make light of any scene involving Darth Vader, but here we are given one surprising, yet heedful laugh during a bit that involves the neo-Darth Vader, Kylo Ren--who is just as bit of creepy and sinister as Vader.The newcomers, John Boyega as an ex-stormtrooper, Finn, and Daisy Ridley as a orphaned scavenger, Rey, will have no problems being the new faces of the franchise. Their characters have a lot of depth already, with much more yet to be explored.Harrison Ford is back as Han Solo, and he's better than he's ever been. His performance is actually award-worthy. I mean, just give the guy an Oscar already (he's only had 1 nomination ever--seriously).And what is Star Wars without a couple twists? The ones that we're given are great, and you know they're stringing you along for more. They don't answer every question in this film. They answer a lot, but still leave you talking afterwards and speculating. It teaches us to be patient and we're surprisingly okay with that. The film doesn't give in to the immediate gratification that the Avengers culture usually demands.It runs at 135 minutes, but feels no longer than 100. The pacing is basically near-perfect, which attributes to it's deceptive length.I truly didn't want it to end. It's the year's best film and perhaps the best one I've seen in at least 5 years. It gave me the happy chills about eleven different times. I can't even begin to explain how good it is. I guess you're just going to have to see it for yourself. Who am I kidding? Everyone's about to watch this movie. But that's Star Wars for ya.Twizard Rating: 100
ID_100152	6	"Hypocritical marketing and lazy writing took the magic from Star Wars.I'm not disappointed with this movie, I just move on. Furthermore I believe this is what a lot of other Cinephils and probably some ""Star Wars"" Fans are going to do as well. Not a problem for Disney, for sure. But as they don't give a s---,I'm now ""forced"" to do the same.Funny thing is, I convinced my 10 year younger girlfriend to watch the midnight screening for this, because I had hoped after reading Disney is going to take this seriously, even with a whole story-group overlooking the new movies, where there are more women involved would be really interesting. Turns out some old guys like Ridley Scott, George Miller, a middle aged Tarantino and even George Lucas himself to some extent in his OT, are far more capable when it comes to write strong believable female characters.After Mad Max Fury Road we talked the whole night about that movie until we had sexual intercourse, after the Force awakens we proceeded right to the juicy bit, without much talk. I'm one of those guys who likes both intercourse and conversation, figure yourself which movie my girlfriend was really in awe with and in which she was bored to sleep.I loved JJ Abrams Star Trek for what it is, I can have fun with such stuff, if it's done right. But, well... He made such a fool of himself here, it's kinda funny really, because of the marketing, NOT because of the movie. Movie was average, nothing to talk about really, but because of the insulting marketing. Movie target group could be considered uneducated teenagers with a lot of money, the marketing not so. Should be remembered. The ""professional"" critics *cough* must not be forgotten. I imagine a hard life to be chained to whatever you think you're chained to.I'm so proud about my girlfriend now, even more than before, that I really have to thank Disney and JJ for this. As intended? Hehe, I don't think so. What does a Kiri Hart or Kathleen Kennedy see in their mirrors now? Well probably dollars or something, I guess.To all those,"" IT FEELS LIKE STAR WARS!!1"" 10 stars reviews. You should watch some adds featuring Star Wars, they feel like Star Wars. A movie with the tag Star Wars should for sure not just feel like it, it should be plain Star Wars and not only felt alike. Enjoy it nonetheless, which is fine for me. Live and let live. That's diversity.Mathhew Vaughn is the only director here, who gained a lot of credit because of Star Wars The Force Awakens. The initiated will know why.Star Wars TFA 6,9/10 good scifi-fantasy, nothing more, perhaps less."
ID_100153	8	I'm not objective on this. I know. I don't care. I love Star Wars. This has all the Star Wars feeling from beginning to end. The plot works. The characters are well defined, are different from each other and feel authentic. The way we're introduce to each of the old classics is exemplary. I love it.
ID_100154	10	"'STAR WARS: THE FORCE AWAKENS': Five Stars (Out of Five)The seventh installment in the immensely popular space opera film series; and the first chapter in over ten years. It takes place 30 years after the events of 'RETURN OF THE JEDI'; when the Galactic Empire has now become 'The First Order', and the rebel alliance has now become the 'Resistance'. The story deals with a First Order stormtrooper, named Finn, who's looking for redemption; after gaining possession of a map, to Luke Skywaler's whereabouts. The film was directed by J.J. Abrams; and it was written by Abrams, Michael Arndt and Lawrence Kasdan (who also co-wrote 'THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK' and 'RETURN OF THE JEDI'). Harrison Ford, Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher, Peter Mayhew, Anthony Daniels and Kenny Baker all reprise their roles, from the original trilogy; and they're joined by newcomers Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, Adam Driver and Oscar Isaac. The series creator, George Lucas, returned as a creative consultant; and John Williams once again scored the music (as he did all six previous chapters, in the franchise). I think it's the most entertaining movie, I've seen, in 35 years!We first learn that Luke Skywalker (Hamill) has gone missing; and due to his absence, the ruthless First Order has gained power, and control, over the galaxy. Princess Leia Organa (Fisher) is now a general, of the Resistance, and she believes finding Luke is humanity's only hope. She sends her best X-wing fighter pilot, named Poe Dameron (Isaac), to the desert planet of Jakku; in order to locate a map, which can lead to her brother's whereabouts. On his mission Poe meets a stormtrooper, looking for redemption, named Finn (Boyega). Finn joins Poe in his adventure; he also later teams up with a scavenger, named Rey (Ridley), and a veteran war hero, named Han Solo (Ford).The film is definitely the best written, of the entire franchise; with clever, witty dialogue (for the first time, in the series). It also has the most humanity, and thoughtful drama (I cried multiple times). It's surreal seeing Han, Luke, Leia, Chewbacca, and other original cast members, on the big screen again (in a new movie); and I think it was justifiable asking Fisher and Hamill to lose weight, for their parts (it's necessary to the roles they're playing). The new characters are also extremely likable, and soon to be classic, as well. Ridley is a revelation, and I think she rivals Jennifer Lawrence; for one of the best performances of the year! Driver, Boyega and Isaac are all fantastic as well; and Ford is, once again, classic! The movie (without question) deserves several Oscar nominations; for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Original Screenplay, acting and more. The approach Abrams takes, to the material, is exactly right (it's traditional, old fashioned filmmaking). The film is everything you could possibly expect (or want) from a 'STAR WARS' movie; it's funny, heartfelt, touching and action-packed. All of the best parts of the previous installments, with none of the cheese! It's at least the best in the series since 'THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK'!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://vimeo.com/149466777"
ID_100155	6	While this movie isn't bad per se, it's about as surface-level as a film can get. It's a cash grab. I hadn't heard a thing about the movie before watching it, so I went into the experience without any bias whatsoever.I don't think this even deserves a lengthy review which explains everything that's wrong with it. All you need to know is this movie isn't an evolution on Star Wars and I think that's what we all somewhat expected in 2016. It's basically a remake that failed.Events just happen in this movie because they do. That's why. There's no significant background or genuine emotion being projected from any of the characters. Is it entertaining? Sure. But it isn't good. It's stale, lacks character development, and only wants to impress you with late 1970s effects.
ID_100156	9	"Easily the best Star Wars film in the sequel trilogy.
It was a good basis and I loved the rendition to a new home which was clever by Abrams.
Should be appreciated by many.
Shame the last Jedi didn't quite follow that down that path that Abrams left...
JJ Abrams should have directed the whole sequel trilogy and I'm sure if that would've been the way.. The outcome sure as hell would've been different from a very divided Star Wars fan base."
ID_100157	7	"Episode IV was seen on an European beach movie theater in 1978, real stars in the sky, fake stars on the screen. It was unbelievable, purely magic. 1981 ""the Empire strikes back"" was released, new creations, especially ""Yoda"" and the new empire spaceships, planet Hoth, the city in the clouds etc... Episode VI was a panting expectation. Released in 1983, many critics saw it as weak. Still, new creations like the Ewoks or the woods vehicles were to see. The saga was almost finished. The galaxy was at peace.Episode 1 to 3 were also an attempt to create, sometimes very clumsy though. A very poor Darth Vader young man, but good Ewan McGregor and Natalie Portman, new things were also to discover, like Boba Fett father, new space vehicles, undersea world...But what is wrong with Episode VII ? Everything. Nothing is new, no creation at all. You take the best of Episode IV to VI, remixes it with a couple of new characters like the wonderful Rey (she is really good), you add in your salad a new emperor and his new disciple, a pathetic Darth.. what ? Son of Han Solo. Then, a coloured actor who is fully lost (Finn), and a new cute robot. That's it. The technical side is of course perfect. It is indeed. I do not believe George Lucas has appreciated the finality.It is said that we are 30 years after episode VI. What has changed in 30 years ? Nothing, the spaceships are the same (my car brand has evolved in this long time), imperial destroyers, imperial fighters, rebel X-Wings fighters are identical. We add a new so called Jabba, a new Cantina and a new death star on top and the salad is done.Ridiculous at most. What is the target of the makers ? Money of course, they reach the kids and drag the original fans to the movie theaters, like me. From 7 to 77 as Hergé said. Good move, bad movie ! Seven points for the technique."
ID_100158	8	"I was seven when I first watched Star Wars (1977). Like many nineties kids' I watched the beloved first trilogy on VHS, in the days before George Lucas's Industrial Light and Magic had its way with the ""Deluxe DVD"" modified version. The space saga of Luke an Leia was never bestowed upon me by my parents with fond memories of the premiere. My mother, though fond of musicals, was not much for sci-fi or action movies; my father even less so. It was my older brothers who first sat me down to gaze upon its glory and since those days, every space adventure I have watched over the years lives or dies on the standard of the Star Wars.I say all this not only to lay out my fandom bonafides but also to highlight that my thoughts of Star Wars: The Force Awakens comes from a contemplative place and not the blather of a movie snob or a knee- jerk reaction to the whims of the crowd. I, among others have been burned by this franchise before and repeated viewings of the prequels only serves to underline a simple truth; not everything your loved when you were a teenager was good. So the question now is will this continuation of a long time ago, in a galaxy far away be re-watchable a decade from now?I short yes. Star Wars: The Force Awakens is a glorious epic of enormous beauty and scale. The pulse-pounding action, the unabashedly sincere characters and the small smatterings of brevity work to be the kick in the pants movies of this ilk have needed for decades. The welcome return of familiar faces liberally mixed with new and interesting characters gives the franchise all the ammo it needs to become the primary movie franchise for a whole new generations of padawans. The stakes are just as high, the acting is just as strong and the direction is just as flawless.The fact that everything works is no accident either. Director J.J. Abrams very purposely set up all the pieces of his puzzle with similar aplomb as the original creators (George Lucas, Gay Kurtz, Gilbert Taylor et al.). In many cases Abrams even used the same pieces. The score is still provided by the illustrious John Williams, the film itself was shot in the same aspect ration on 35mm film and emphasis was given to practical special effects over computer generated. Also on-board was original scribe for The Empire Strikes Back (1980) Lawrence Kasdan who co-wrote Force Awakens with Abrams.This is where there are some unfortunate kinks in the armor however. As irreproachable as we feel the originals are, they are not in-fact flawless. Thus much of the problems that plague the originals also plague Force Awakens specifically the dialogue and characterization. Daisy Ridley and John Boyega do a fine job finding the deeper meanings of the force/dark side, even when the story needs them to act against their own self interest (their love patter leave much to be desired however). Adam Driver's Kylo Ren on the other hand seems to falter not just under the wait of the franchises most iconic villain, Darth Vader but under the weight of his character's conflicts. Darth Vader never needed to throw a hissy fit with a lightsaber; a cold dead look was enough to make us think he was serious. My guess is in the sequels to come, a rift between him and Domhnall Gleeson's General Hux will solidify Kylo Ren as the sinister force he needs to be.In that lies the future success of the Star Wars franchise; what happens next? J.J. Abrams has a tendency to leave absolutely everything out on the field thus the reason why Alias (2001-2006), Lost (2004-2010) and Fringe (2008-2013) all petered into rambling shadows of their former selves. Likewise, the fantastical wonder that was Star Trek (2009) hit a creative deja vu by the time Star Trek: Into Darkness (2013) arrived on the scene. In this case however, I think there's more, much more to the saga than an almost surgical emulation of the originals. Abrams is building something, something big and it's going places."
ID_100159	9	Ok, so Disney have got their hands on the Star Wars franchise and too many people don't like it - BOO HOO!Born in 1975 I grew up with Star Wars in my DNA, and I realise that nothing will ever match the scale and success of the original trilogy, but don't hate this for doing it's best!All the new characters work! They appeal to a new audience and they are humorous and very cool. Nostalgia is abundant with the return of Han, Leia and Chewy! What's not to enjoy????Littered with epic scenes this movie builds a new Star Wars world with a new threat born out of the old evil empire. Yes it's similar, but does that really make it bad???? The tech has evolved along realistic timelines to deliver more powerful weapons that aren't too different to the old weapons, is that really so bad???To score this movie with 1 or 2 stars is a joke, so along with the movie why don't you all hate this review and vote it down. Or you could simply stop watching these movies if you all hate them so much!If, like me, you can unplug and enjoy Star Wars again then watch this and enjoy it. It's far better than the haters say it is!9/10
ID_100160	10	"Let's get one thing straight: the plot is derivative. There are tons of parallels to Star Wars: A New Hope, and pretty much the same events are going on.But what I was most surprised about was that I didn't care. I've talked with friends who have also seen it, and our consensus was that that part was obvious, but that none of us care. The reason why is because it was so well executed, and the new stuff brought to the table was probably the best parts of the movie.For starters, let's talk the new characters, because they're the main focus: they're fantastic. Rey was an awesome and inspiring lead. Finn was fearless if not naive and brought so much enthusiasm to the movie throughout. BB-8 was surprisingly absolutely adorable--to give any examples of his behavior would be to spoil some really charming moments. Poe was a pleasant surprise, because the trailers didn't show him off much but he was an absolute joy to watch. Captain Phasma is my only complaint--heavily underutilized in this movie.The big standout for me, however, was Adam Driver as Kylo Ren. Let it be known: he is NOT Vader 2.0. He doesn't try to be Vader 2.0. To go any further would be to spoil the movie, but trust me, he's one of the most interesting characters to come out of Star Wars in a long time.The old cast returns and is given amazing justice. This isn't them returning right back to their characters--this is them embodying their characters as they are decades later. Harrison Ford in particular was brilliant in his role and mannerisms.Visual effects: Outstanding. For the most part, the movie uses practical effects, and it really shows, because the movie is super engaging throughout its duration. Try to compare some of these scenes to those in any in the Star Wars prequels, and you'll see what I mean. Once again, I can't spoil details. It's funny, because there are only a handful of creatures and moments that use CG effects, and those are the ones that end up sticking out.Writing: Also super well done. A big flaw in the prequels is that everything got mired in unnecessary and redundant details. The most quoted lines from the prequels are most often the ones that are so stupid it's hard not to forget them (the sand monologue, for example). Meanwhile, everyone I've seen can't stop quoting random pieces of dialogue from the new movie that are so well done and so memorable. The dialogue is interesting, feels real, and leaves for some amazing one-liners--super reminiscent of the original trilogy in that way.Story: As I mentioned, yes it's derivative, but that doesn't mean it's not done super well. Plus, the scenes that have no parallels to A New Hope are some of the best in the movie. Much of the final act, for example, is not easily paralleled, and I was kept on the edge of my seat pretty much the entire movie. People here seem to be criticizing the movie for it's ""plot holes"". Most of these aren't even plot holes though! They're so explicitly left as mysteries so they can be answered and expanded upon in the next movie! Which is what's making people super excited for the next movie already!Also, my biggest complaint with J.J. Abrams' other works is how convoluted and roundabout they get. But Star Wars is meant to have much more straightforward stories (also something the prequels with the exception of ROTS were not good at). J.J. Abrams seems to have acknowledged this because this movie definitely feels like Star Wars in its far more straightforward approach. It feels much less confused and mired in details, and always seems to keep the main plot line going.Music: It's John Williams. It's memorable. Especially after seeing the movie a second time. It feels like Star Wars, and it enhances every moment wonderfully.Lightsabers: Okay, so without spoiling anything, I will say that the lightsaber fights in this movie will blow you away. They're big, dangerous, brutal, emotive, natural, and use the environments in super interesting ways. The fights in this movie are some of the best fights I've seen in the series history.Conclusion: Like I said, the plot frame is the same as A New Hope's. In many respects, it is the same. But it feels different than ANH, and yet it still feels like Star Wars. And it is executed so well that it was hard to even care that it followed the same frame. And the best parts of the movie are the new parts. The movie is intended to return to the heart and soul that made Star Wars so great in the first place, and it succeeds at that with flying colors. Engaging dialogue, great one-liners, awesome action sequences, a great character-driven plot, and a general captivation by the galaxy far, far away.Also, keep in mind, I made sure to write this review only after a few days of heavily considering all of the elements of this movie, and after seeing the movie a second time. My opinion hasn't changed. In fact, it got even better (originally I gave this movie a 9).Note, however: Now that the series is re-grounded in excellency, it's up to Rian Johnson to create an Episode VIII that takes the series to completely new places with a brand new plot based on all the brand new things this movie has brought to the table. If it doesn't, then Episode VII will be remembered as the film that spawned a rehashed series. If it does, however, then Episode VII will be remembered as an excellently-executed reintroduction to the series that had been long lost in a ""meh"" prequel trilogy and some very questionable Expanded Universe decisions (with the exception of stories like Thrawn and Revan)."
ID_100161	7	"1977 people saw for the first time the big title of Star Wars on the big screen, and after Star Wars: The Revenge of The Sith came out 2005 the world known franchise went disappearing. I saw The Force Awakened 2015 on its premiere night and it was clear that people had been waiting long for Star Wars to return to the big screen, and there is no doubt that J.J Abrams must have felt much pressure taking this franchise back to the big screen as it is certainly one of the most loved and respected movie franchises in the world. Much has changed between 1977-2015 and the world we humans live in daily have changed much both for good and for bad. But one of the great changes that have happened in the world is that women and colored people are allowed a bigger role in movie production both in front of the camera and behind it. To see Daisy Ridley and John Boyega as the two main protagonists was an amazing experience as they both looked like they truly enjoyed themselves and both delivered their performances with nothing but excellence. Adam Driver also delivered a solid performance and it was a complete joy to see Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher return to the big screen and to the galaxy far far away. The movie itself was an amazing space adventure form the beginning to end and I thought that J.J Abrams really captured the magic and feeling of Star Wars just as George Lucas did for the first time in 1977. The movie had a very good balance and it had many things that could be enjoyed by the longtime fans but also much new for the new generation whom some witnessed Star Wars for the first time. And yeah I'll admit it. I was one of those guys who suddenly ""got something in his eye"" when Han Solo & Chewbacca came into the shot and Han said: ""Chewie we're home""A must see for all fans of space adventure and definitely for all who love Star Wars!10/10 Amazing!"
ID_100162	10	We've waited.... and waited..... and here it is! The Force Awakens is everything we've come to love about Star Wars. It's big, it's epic, it's spectacular. And underneath, there's actually a big heart to it all. You get a sense from watching it, that it was made by true fans of the series. I won't give away any real spoilers- but rest assured Jar Jar Binks does not put in an appearance, so remain calm. The good guys are very likable, I thought the relationship between Ray and Finn worked out very well. It gave the film it's emotional anchor. The villains are pretty much what you would expect, but the filmmakers threw in a few twists about them that were welcome.Add some terrific space battles, and you get a very welcome return to the greatness of Star Wars. Go and see it (but you already know you will). Take a friend or a family member. You'll have a great time. Because that's what these films are about when it comes down to it. Overall, Force Awakens shows off some snazzy visual effects combined with a compelling story and great characters. It won't disappoint.
ID_100163	7	"In a galaxy far, far away Star Wars. It's about time we should see that opening to a film. 10 years since the last Star Wars Film, J.J Abrams takes the time to get it right. And he does it perfectly. I won't say anything about the plot, because I'm sure you want to find what it is yourself. But I will tell you of a New, Epic Adventure. The Force Awakens gets it right. It blends old and new together in a way the prequel Trilogy really failed to do. We had new characters( Finn, Rey, Poe, Kylo Ren, BB-8) and old ( Han Solo, Chewbacca, Leia, C3PO, R2-D2), that combined together to make a fitting and suitable Stars Wars film that would make George Lucas Proud. The Force Awakens doesn't make the mistake of copying everything awesome about the original trilogy, but it respects and honours it. It makes its only original story, and it really is quite a great story. But that's enough of me, I think you would rather see this Fantastic Film then listen to me ramble on about it"
ID_100164	7	So disappointed. Can only assume that the previous ratings are based on brain washed fans so happy to hear the anthem and see the yellow writing scroll up the screen that they didn't bother to watch what followed. The aforementioned opening was by far the highlight. 30 mins in and I had to nudge myself to stay awake. 60 mins in I would have walked out in disgust if I didn't think I would offend my wife and daughter who had decided to accompany me on my quest to re-capture my youth. The lack of a story was unbelievable. The main villain is a fluffy bunny next to Vader, Maul or Sidious. What rocket scientist decided that Stormtroopers were no longer clones. I'd be easily convinced that Abrams hadn't even watched the original movies, if it wasn't for the shameful way that every scene from Episode IV had been woefully reproduced. Predictable and not an original scene in the movie. I know you have to watch it, but do yourself a favour and wait till it hits TV.
ID_100165	4	"""What did you come back for?"" - the first question I would ask the creators of the new Star Wars trilogy...Disappointment is all, the story was perfectly finished, the character lines are logically closed, so why did you decide to continue again, introduce new characters, start a completely different story and somehow connect it with the original one? The answer is simple - popularity and money.I really love the Star Wars franchise, which is why it hurts me to watch them ruin everything, starting with episode 7 and ending with the future 9th...Moreover, this is not just a sequel, this is some kind of unsuccessful remake, in which they tried to repeat in a different form all the chips of the 4 part - and it turned out, to put it mildly, ridiculous and terrible..."
ID_100166		"The best thing I could say about this movie, is that it has set itself up for a better sequel. I'm just going to go ahead and list my grievances, without giving anything away: -""Knowledge of the force"" was a very important factor in how good a Jedi was at fighting over the first six movies. There was years of training, infinite hurdles. That all goes out the window. Apparently, anyone can beat a Sith lord. -The premise of the main characters, their motives and backgrounds, was so much less believable (even as a fictitious storyline). -The fight scenes were less like the epic battles of Episodes I, II, and III, and more like the fight between Obi-Wan and Vader. -The villain was so boring. Abrams didn't pull any brain muscles thinking him up. -The story altogether was extremely weak -Finally but most importantly, this was less of a sequel and more of a remake of Episode IV. I won't tell you how, but you'll see it.Good things about this movie: -Stunning 3D visuals -The imperial starships are as cool as ever -Han Solo is still a bossI want to tell readers to just go watch it with lowered expectations.. but there are no expectations low enough to make this movie a good watch. Just don't bother going"
ID_100167	10	"There has been an awakening and it is awesome! No offense to those Ewoks, but STAR WARS: THE FORCE AWAKENS is the best 'Star Wars' movie since 'The Empire Strikes Back.' This film is exciting, it's fun, but it's also heart-wrenching and deeply affecting. Clearly the result of a work done with care.Now this a spoiler-free review, I'm going to keep it that way because this film does have a pivotal plot point that if you spoil it, it would certainly ruin the entire experience. So the secret must be kept until you see it for yourself, it is that crucial.The story is set years after the events in ""Return Of The Jedi,"" Leia is now a general leading the resistance, and Luke Skywalker has gone missing, the mystery of his whereabouts is constant throughout the film, it is what drives the good guys and the first order, finding Luke becomes their cause. Oscar Isaac plays a great pilot named Poe Dameron who gets captured by the villain Kylo Ren (Adam Driver). But a stormtrooper with a conscience, Finn (John Boyega) helps Finn escape, a situation which then leads to Finn encountering Rey, (Daisy Ridley) a scavenger who's just trying to get by and survive each day. A new adorable droid, BB8, enters their lives and gives them a mission which leads them to Millennium Falcon and Han Solo. These young ones learn about the past, that the jedi and the force are all real. Meanwhile a threat far more sinister and much larger than the death star is wreaking havoc. These new characters will ultimately have to choose whether to stay as who they are or become something more.What's awesome about STAR WARS: THE FORCE AWAKENS is that J.J. brought back everything we loved about the old original ""Star Wars"" films. He brought back all the fun and excitement that the prequels lacked because those episodes I,II, and III were too busy trying too hard to be political thrillers. J.J. brought back the Millennium falcon and the thrill of aerial fight. Even the light saber fights on the ground are extremely well-choreographed, they keep you on the edge of your seat.I think the new kids on the block, Boyega, Isaac, Driver, Ridley, all did a fantastic job, and they can go toe-to-toe with the legends, Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher and Luke Skywalker. I think the writers, J.J. Abrams, Lawrence Kasdan, and Michael Arndt smartly written the film in a way that would bridge the gap between these two generations. STAR WARS: THE FORCE AWAKENS is nostalgic for us who've been fans ever since we could remember, but it embraces new fans who may not know much but will now learn more because of this film. It's a great way to pass the baton, it also makes way for the next installment, EPISODE VIII and IX.This is a very well thought-out film, not a single boring note, nothing about it seems hasty or abrupt, it's well-structured and well-crafted from start to finish. I love how Rey and Finn start out not having a purpose but they end up choosing their own, this is not about destiny placed upon you, it's still up to them in the end, just like how it's my choice to plan on watching this film again and again until I memorize every single line and dialogue.You geek out when you see something familiar, you geek out when you see something new, you laugh, you cry, you can feel your pulse pounding through the action sequences, STAR WARS: THE FORCE AWAKENS is why you go to the theaters. Any of us who had doubts when Disney bought Lucasfilm can now admit that that may have actually been a pretty smart move on their part, definitely a good thing that happened to this property."
ID_100168	8	"As I said before, I am not a Star Wars fan but all of these films are very exciting and very entertaining. This one, Force Awakens, is a pretty strong and astonishing eye candy with plot to match and excellent actors' chemistry to binge watching and enjoy.
I need not retell the plot but what I can say, this is a fine element of a bigger mosaic and as a definitive piece it holds well, showing that not only excellent CGI or great vision can create a stunning effect, but also a thoughtful idea, careful approach to depicting baddies, strong twists and very subtle grain of humor add a real lot of greatness and grandeur.
Good movie with Daisy Ridley and Harrison Ford as well as Adam Driver shining great and not allowing te plot to slide into banality or sentimentality.
I await a new episode and hope they will prove more."
ID_100169	6	"When I watched this movie it looked good to me; better than most fiction movies I watched in 2005. I think it's 8.3 IMDb rating is justified but I didn't get why this movie has got so many bad reviews. I think I have never seen any movie which got so many bad reviews on IMDb and still enjoys 8.3 overall rating. This prompted me to watch the earlier star war episodes and I got my answer.This movie doesn't do justice with the original star wars trilogy. It lacks imagination as the plot is a mixture of the events from earlier episodes. And most importantly it failed to live up to spiritual essence of star wars saga. It is a huge commercial success but a disappointment to hardcore star wars fans. I hope the coming episode might be able to rescue this trilogy like the third episode did to some extent."
ID_100170	10	"I saw some of these moronic reviews on IMDb for this movie from 'so called' critics and I laughed out loud at their reasons why they hated it. But these reviewers are just amateurs who try to bash a great movie. What did the professional reviewers write? USA Today 4 out of 4 stars, the Guardian 5 out of 5 Stars, The SF Chronicle 5 out of 5 stars, The Wall Street Journal 5 out of 5 stars, the headline - ""The Star Wars you have been waiting for"". If the movie is as bad as the amateur critics on IMDb states, why does it have an 8.1 rating here? Why did this movie gross over $2 billion dollars if word of mouth regarding the flick mirrored the crappy reviews found on IMDb? These reviewers who tell you that The Force Awakens it is a bad flick are just bitter people who live in the basement of their moms' home. I have seen the movie twice including IMAX and love it. The movie is 150 minutes long but feels 90 minutes. It's a great film – the two best movies of 2015 were Mad Max and The Force Awakens."
ID_100171		"OK, first, the reason for the 5/10 is that I could not watch it again. There is not a lot of plot tension or complexity, and the movie is a little long and schmaltzy ... but, this is so much better than I thought it would be, I am glad I went to see it, it was fun.""The Force Awakens"" like all the Star Wars movies doesn't make much sense, but it had the feeling of the Star Wars series that even the Stars Wars official movies had kind of lost. That make a big impression on me. I really did not expect much, and I sadly went assuming I might just be fed up and have to leave after a few minutes, like I wanted to in the Star Trek reboots, which I hated with a passion.But the movie is beautiful, it is true to all the style and shots and quirks of Star Wars, but that means it is also thin, vapid, silly and basically low IQ Science Fantasy for kids. So, it is that kind of movie. Which is acceptable, that is all is had to be. It is just a movie to watch and eat popcorn and then talk about how this scene reminded you of another movie or situation.Star Wars was one of a kind, in its own time, and it really cannot be recreated, but this movie is hugely successful financially, or course, and so it met expectations - that is an amazing accomplishment, for Star Wars, For JJ Abrams and for the customers.Again, the movie is beautiful, the images and sets awesome, the views spectacular, and the style true to form ... a great job for a sentimental mediocre movie that will give lots of people two hours of great fun ... once!It would have been nice if Abrams had been able to accomplish the same with Star Trek, but i don't think he really understood Star Trek as he understands Star Wars."
ID_100172	8	"My review is pretty much going to be one of those that are going to be unhelpful for all, I'm afraid. I only write these things so that when I pass on from this mortal world, something of me will remain. With this film though, I did not utterly love it and give it a ten so those that did are going to hate my review while on the other hand I did like the film and did not give it a one, so those that hated it or really disliked it will hate my review. I literally read a review where a person gave this film a one, but there were things he enjoyed about the film. Um, if you give the film the lowest ranking that means there should not be anything in it you enjoyed. There are a whole lot of numbers between 1 and 10 to use! It matters not; the film was good to me as it was better than the prequels. Why? Well for one it had better humor. Another reason? It felt more real while the prequels I felt I was watching people in front of a green screen. I can keep going on, but yeah, this one is better than the prequels; however, that being said, it is not as good as any of the originals either. I was really enjoying the film up until the final act which felt kind of rushed. After a certain character takes a fall, the film just speeds along to its conclusion and I just felt more was needed.The story is a bit of a retread of the first Star Wars film, but I was expecting it to be more so than it was. I felt it had enough new to offer to keep me entertained. Well, like in the first film, a droid is tasked with the final piece of the puzzle as Luke Skywalker has been missing and a new order has arisen to fill the void of the evil Galactic Empire left behind. A young girl and a storm trooper who has had enough will try to get the droid back to the resistance fighters lead by General Leia who is desperately trying to find Luke. They shall get help from Han Solo who has gone back to smuggling and Chewbacca ever loyal Wookie. The new order though has a new weapon that takes the power of the sun to cause devastation and a new evil has appeared in the form of Kylo Ren, a man who wishes to be better than Vadar!It was cool seeing Harrison Ford as Han again and some of the old favorites. Han is about the only one from the original films to make more than basically a cameo appearance though. The new characters are pretty good as Fin the former storm trooper was a bit interesting as was Rey, a mysterious girl who seems to harbor some force powers of her own. My favorite new addition though was Poe as he was very enthusiastic and I am hoping he has a more extended role in the next film. I liked Kylo Ren at first, but he deteriorated kind of badly as the film went along and I am kind of hoping they introduce another Sith lord in the next film, because Ren just did not seem quite competent enough to poise much of a threat without some backup. As I said, the film felt a bit weak during its final act and this character was one of the reasons I felt it weak. As for the new Deathstar, I thought it looked cool and I loved it when that one commanding officer ordered it fired and it took out three planets, but at the same time, one would think they'd stop making them with such obvious weak points! So overall, I thought it was a good film. I am not sure it really warrants all this undue hatred I have seen from various people, nor do I really seeing it being the most awesome film ever. It was a pretty good Star Wars film and to me it felt like a Star Wars film, had they put a bit more effort into the conclusion I would have probably given it a nine, but an eight to me is a good film. A lot of movies this year have gotten eights, as very few movies released lately have really pushed my buttons enough for a higher score with the exception of the latest Mad Max film which is my favorite film I saw in theaters in 2015. This one though capped the year off nicely as I did not see anything that I did not enjoy at the theater this year. If this film had disappointed me like the prequels this would have been the last Star Wars film I was going to see, but I will be seeing the next installment which would be the eighth. Still unsure if I want to watch the Rogue Squadron one."
ID_100173	8	The film manages to capture the essence of Star Wars, and has decent production values. It also provides the audience with intriguing questions about the characters of this film.However, this films relies heavily on the overall feel of the Original Trilogy, evident in its plot that resembles that if A New Hope.In conclusion, this is a fun and interesting film to watch, however, it's dependence on the Original Trilogy material may be limits to the creativity and rewatchability of the film.
ID_100174	10	This movie was fantastic. The new characters we receive are fun and interesting, and we are left to see them fleshed out more as the series continues, which is exciting. The movie is very reminiscent of the Original Trilogy. We have a decent amount of aliens (almost all of which are seen using costumes as opposed to CGI). The plot moves along at a great pace. Nothing is really dragged out, but at the same time it is not so fast that you are left confused. And speaking of confusion, there was none in this movie. It was all very straightforward and everything was very easy to understand. This movie absolutely pays homage to the original from 1977 in many ways, but at the same time I feel that you do not need an in depth knowledge of the previous movies to love this one. A general knowledge of the plot and main characters is all that is needed going into this movie. I will have to see it again to make sure, but at the moment this movie is vying for my favorite Star Wars movie ever with The Empire Strikes Back. But don't take my word for this - go out and experience it for yourself. You will have a delightful time filled with comedy, excitement, action, epic plot reveals, and an overall enjoyable time!EDIT SO I CAN RANT: The people who are giving this one or two stars (for the most part) are being overly critical of this movie. I understand not LOVING this movie, and even perhaps if you felt disappointed because it was not what you were hoping for. But regardless of that, it is impossible not to find SOME aspects you liked. There is comedy, action, and adventure. Even if you feel the movie is a reboot of the original (which to some degrees I may even agree), it was a good movie nonetheless. I have seen some comments dissing the acting, which I strongly disagree on. The acting was great! Maybe not perfect, but definitely enjoyable. John Boyega blew me away, Oscar Isaac was fun, and I absolutely ADORE Daisy Ridley. Harrison Ford was AMAZING as always! He really recaptured Han Solo for this movie. Is this a perfect movie? No, it falls into some traps that all movies fall into. That being said, it is still a fantastic film! Is this a good Star Wars movie? It depends, if you are going into this without considering there will be two more, you will probably be upset and say you won't even bother to see the next two. I feel like this movie spent a lot of time recapturing the originals NOT to BE the originals, but to re-establish those feelings in order to set us up for the bigger picture which will be shown to us through two more movies. Some questions are not answered, but again, we have to wait for the next two to come out before we judge this first one for that. This movie deserves an average/above average rating, and by my personal feelings, I still stand by my 10/10. It DOES NOT deserve the 1, 2, 3 and 4 out of 10 scores I have been seeing. That is just being too judgmental and not open to the continuation of a great series. 5+ ratings, in my opinion, have the best reviews, and really help explain what they did and did not like. This movie has A LOT to offer, and if you go in with an open mind, you won't be disappointed.
ID_100175	8	Seems that everyone either loves or hates this movie. While some people think it's the best star wars, others think it's the worst. I'm in the middle. It's a great film, but far from the best star wars. Better than the prequels, and I even thought it was better than ROTJ. So for me it's the 3rd best star wars film, but it's still a really well made film. It's acted and wrote well, which Rouge one is not. The series needed this refresh, which is why I am mostly okay with the rehashed story. Still, the characters are well written and acted, and the visual effects are stunning
ID_100176	6	"I really liked this movie! Yes it's plot is similar to ""A New Hope"", but the execution is different enough to make it feel fresh. I've seen it twice. In Theaters in 2015 and today. I wanna quickly mention, that the cinematography by Dan Mindel is extremely underrated! It should at least have gotten an Oscar nomination. The score by John Williams is great as always, though not many original cues. ""Rey's Theme"" and ""March of the Resistance"" are however exceptions. Overall a really great experience, great characters, dialogue and a flowing pace delivered by J. J. Abrams. A 4/5 stars from me."
ID_100177		There is no way this film should be rated so highly. You're telling me it's as good as Lord of The rings, the original Star wars films, The Dark Knight, Fight Club etc....? No way... the plot was an exact rehash of Episode IV. Unoriginal, uninspiring, and lackluster all round. The only good thing about it was performances and the nostalgic music, sounds etc. As a stand alone film i'd give it like a 6/10, but since it's being rated so highly I'm going to give it a 1/10. An 8.8/10 film should be original, not a film that is an exact copy and paste of another movie from 30 years ago. I will say, it was better than the prequels in terms of acting, production etc. But even the prequels had better ideas, and MUCH better music. The music wasn't special at all in this - no Dual of The Fates etc etc. Overall im disappointed. Over-hyped to the max.
ID_100178	8	"The Force has indeed awakened, ""Star Wars"" fans. Thanks to Disney's purchase of Lucasfilm we have been gifted a new movie and all the excitement and anxiousness that comes with it. And while it has only been 10 years since the last new ""Star Wars,"" it has been more than 30 years of wondering what happens to the beloved characters of the original trilogy after ""Return of the Jedi."" And so, it is at times a teary-eyed delight to see these old friends return to the big screen. Therefore, before a single trailer surfaced, ""The Force Awakens"" was rife with nostalgia, and few directors understand the sensitivities of nostalgia the way J.J. Abrams does. His film ""Super 8"" was an exercise in '80s nostalgia and his reboot of the ""Star Trek"" franchise also demonstrated respect for decades-old and beloved sci fi/fantasy with massive, dedicated followings. It made him the clear choice – and the safest choice – for ""Star Wars: Episode VII.""In collaboration with writer Lawrence Kasdan (""The Empire Strikes Back,"" ""Return of the Jedi"") and based on some work from Oscar- winner Michael Arndt, Abrams crafts a new ""Star Wars"" chapter that is in turn very safe, but safe in the way of warm old blanket that has been patched back up with some new fabric. Abrams and Kasdan identify and distill classic ""Star Wars"" tropes and re-forge them into a new movie, sometimes down to even the plot details. The result is a constant feeling of familiarity coursing throughout the film and branding it as unequivocally ""Star Wars."" Even many of George Lucas' directing hallmarks are adapted in a show of humble reverence.This was, in many ways, a strategic first move back into ""Star Wars"" by Abrams and producer Kathleen Kennedy because it makes ""The Force Awakens"" somewhat impervious to criticism. By sticking so closely to the formula of old ""Star Wars"" films, the choice for the creative direction can be attributed to homage. That's how you appease fans – they can't complain if what you give them is a near replica of what they fell in love with in the first place.""The Force Awakens"" is truly a film for the fans in this way, with new characters and ideas introduced with a measure of subtlety. The inclusion of Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher and Mark Hamill along with Chewbacca, C-3PO and R2-D2 serve not only the purpose of appeasing fans, but also as a way to transition the story to the new characters, a passing of the torch, of sorts. These folks – ace pilot Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac), stormtrooper-turned-hero Finn (John Boyega), skilled scavenger Rey (Daisy Ridley) and the adorable ball droid BB-8 – are the real gems of ""The Force Awakens"" in their performances and characters (not unlike the fresh faces of ""A New Hope"" at one time were) and will take future episodes to great new corners of the galaxy. What feels new – or what Abrams adds to the ""Star Wars"" universe – is a greater sense of danger and an appropriate degree of complexity. I wouldn't call ""The Force Awakens"" violent, but there's an added realism and grit to the violence to the action sequences of this film that Lucas seemed to avoid in all six previous episodes – and it makes a difference. There's so much more tension and suspense. Adam Driver as Kylo Ren also brings an element of unpredictability and complexity to the pantheon of ""Star Wars"" villains, who have usually been very stoic, enigmatic and dignified. Ren is none of these, though arguably he aspires to be.But complexity doesn't necessarily translate to depth. ""The Force Awakens"" comes off as purposefully vague at times (about character history and anything that's happened in the last 30 years) and doesn't linger on one idea or in one place for very long. The story moves at hyper-speed, as if by avoiding any stationary activity it can stave off the many questions the audience will surely have about, well, everything. It wants to be fun and exciting, not bog you down with details about how the First Order came to power, what went on between Leia and Han since we last saw them, why the Rebellion is now the Resistance, etc. The most common negatively inclined thought one will probably have throughout the film or after is: ""I expected there to be something more to that."" And that's probably what Abrams preferred. Better you should be upset with something you wanted to see because it means you were intrigued, than because something was in the movie that you despised. Whatever questions you had, whatever characters you wanted to know more about or see more of, can be addressed in the next two films. It's a smart move.But most importantly, Abrams puts the emphasis back on the characters and that's why ""The Force Awakens"" works and will win audiences over. The actors and the story give us enough of the characters to care about their journey, in the same way we did in ""A New Hope."" That's the essence of ""Star Wars"" and that's why fans will be clamoring for ""Episode VIII."" ~Steven CThanks for reading! Visit Movie Muse Reviews for more"
ID_100179	10	"The movie is undoubtedly made with a lot of details and attention, scenes are well crafted and the dialogues are well written. There's a classic feel of the old Star Wars movies to this and also the visuals of the new world. 
The old cast mark, Carrie, Harrison and the rest are as good as they've ever been and also the new crew Daisy and John are amazing. 
The score of the movie is the best I've heard in a long long time. The movie made over 2 billion dollars and well it desverved it."
ID_100180	6	"Director J.J. Abrams (""Lost,"" ""Star Trek Into Darkness,"" ""Mission: Impossible III"") steps into the future (again) to bring the latest of the Star Wars trilogy to the big screen. Not seeing any of the prior movies, I was poised and ready for an exciting film experience. Unfortunately, I feel asleep twice due to boredom. Sure, the spaceships are cool, the futuristic characters are interesting, and traveling through the galaxy looks like fun, but I've seen this all done before in any number of other space travel films/TV series. With something new to look for out of the question, I turned my attention to just enjoying the film for what it was and getting to know the characters. Unfortunately, the dialogue was so basic, I found it hard to stay interested. I was, however, amused to see Harrison Fords' character filled with so much dry-humor, and I now finally understand the attraction of the light-saber. Maybe if some new film technology had been introduced, the overall film would have meant more to this first timer. But, since that didn't happen, ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" just bored me with its familiarity. One of the highlights of the film was to see Adam Driver (""GIRLS"") step into such an iconic role within the film. Driver continues to be an interesting actor, and it's great to see him successful jump genres here. May the force be with those who love this trilogy!"
