ID_100211	I just recently re-watched it force awakens and honestly the criticisms of the film are just bull crap specially the whole thing that feels like a new hope. It feels more like return of the Jedi but even then it's just a Star Wars movie it's ambition's the only criticism that really works is that sometimes it's to safe but it's really ambitious.sometimes people seem to forgot tiny details especially about things that don't match with there bias/head canon. There's like a lot foreshadowing people miss especially with snoke like most theories that are about him were trash . A great start to a good/great trilogy.
ID_100212	A lot of people complained about the similarities between this and the original but I thought it was kind of a fun ode but still its own sort of thing. After seeing the horrifically awful Last Jedi I think we can all agree this one looks even better in retrospect. JJ Abrams clearly loves it and you can feel that and I think it's pretty great.
ID_100213	I will tell you what I liked, didn't like and then talk spoilers in this order. The force has definitely been awakened and yes you will feel it in the theatre. I was clapping and cheering, people were doing it and you will too. I absolutely loved the new characters Fin, Kylo Ren and Rey. My favourite was Rey but I'm sure everyone will have their own favourite out of the trio. The other character I liked was Snoke and the New order commander. It is hard to make new characters extremely likable especially with the previous legendary cast being around but they did it. There is a surprisingly big amount of comedy in this film and I found myself laughing a lot. Obviously we know the old cast are in the movie and they do not disappoint (with minor exception that does not apply). Han solo was Han damn Solo and that was amazing! The film has beautiful scenery and new cool creatures which is a nice addition to the Star Wars galaxy. Now by all means, going into this movie I lowered my expectations and told myself I shouldn't judge the movie negatively just because the 'old Star Wars' feeling isn't there but that is not the issue. The movie has technical issues and Star Wars related issues. The technical issues are that the film is incomplete - leaves more questions than answered and a cliffhanger. The other technical issue is the plot is too similar to previous films. The Star Wars related issues are that: there was a lack of original score for the characters which is something Star Wars always has done. Some characters have such a small average role that really makes you question all that marketing and hype behind them. There is little or no dialogue at some critical scenes which I feel like there should have been. But the main issue here is that this movie would be really good if you watch the coming episodes back to back because it feels more like a serial on Netflix and it shouldn't be like that, it should be a full movie on it's own and continue the saga in the coming episodes. Now for the ******SPOILERS******* Did I just watch an extended trailer or was that the movie?!!! The movie is too short! The shots in the trailers with the knights of Ren and Luke with R2D2 are a vision scene in the movie which last the same amount of time as in the trailers!!!!! Thats it...a few seconds!!! The new death star was amazing, it was badass it looked invincible the New Order looked like the new big thing and all of a sudden the rebels come up with a plan to blow up the death star in mere seconds send in like a few x-wings and they blow it up along with every new order on it.....um WHAT?!!! seriously?! The victory for the rebels was so unrewarding, I could not believe they actually did it all again and expected us to cheer. So many inconsistency with characters in the movie like is Fin a Jedi or not if not then how does he battle Kylo Ren so well and even injure him!!! If yes he is a Jedi, how did he learn how to use a light saber so fast and match Kylo Ren who has had training as a Jedi from Luke his uncle and as a sith from Snoke. How does Rey learn the ways of the force and so well?! Just because she is strong with the force doesn't automatically make her a master Jedi fighter! Anakin Skywalker was the strongest Force sensitive person in the galaxy and he needed years of training to match other Jedi and Sith. Rey was too powerful! To the point where did didn't make sense and you start to realize it's not supposed to because Diney is trying to make a Disney princess out of her!!! What happened to Kylo Ren?? did he survive the blast explosion of the new death star?! snoke told the commander to bring him but they never show that he survives and thats not how it should have been addressed. That is not how you do anticipation for the next film. they should have shown him flying out injured on a craft, thats it! Are they trying to make us think that he's dead and surprise us by bringing him back?! how cliché would that be!!! Captain phasma was such a disappointment because she is there just as a cameo!!! she barely has any role! They cast an amazing actress and give her an amazing look and they don't even use her, she could have playing a stormtrooper and we wouldn't have felt the difference. Luke Skywalker is NOT in the movie!!! just at the very end he turns stares into Rey and the credits role...what?! what ever happened to C3PO's hand!!!?? I thought we were gonna know!! so basically we have to watch episode 8 to see Star Wars!!! this movie was just a trailer tease for Episode 8. We still don't know if snoke is Darth Plagueis but I don't have a problem with that, he looked badass. What was all that marketing with Ray's staff?! she has it in the beginning, then doesn't have it through out the movie and then at the end she magically has it again. Is that staff something special?! they didn't tell us anything so basically all that marketing was not for this movie but the next if her staff is actually something special like light saber or Darth plagueis's Saber. You know now I question the studio for putting a sudden embargo on the reviews for the movie after the premiere. I thought they were doing that for spoilers but apparently they were doing it because they sensed bad reviews would hurt the movie.
ID_100214	Star Wars Episode VII: The Force Awakens is directed by J.J. Abrams. This film takes place over 20 years after The Return Of The Jedi. It was long awaited, but it definitely delivered. This film is everything you want a Star Wars film to be. It further deepens and gives purpose to the original characters, as well as introduces very likeable new additions. The action sequences are all incredible. This film really makes the most of modern CGI, but also does many things practically, which is essential for a Star Wars film. It is important that I speak about the new villain, Kylo Ren. This guy is awesome! He's such a deep and complex character. There is so much conflict within him, and when learning more about his back story, it makes you really view him as more than just an evil antagonist. The main criticism of the film surrounds the fact that it seems to follow and share similarities to the original trilogy, particularly A New Hope. I can see how perhaps they played it safe. But in my opinion all they did was improve on it and explore everything on a much deeper level. Star Wars: The Force Awakens contains such great writing and film making so therefore I give it a 9.
ID_100215	"OK I am a fan, but not a fanatic! to begin with, the movie is solely carried on the tiny shoulders of Daisy Ridley (Rey), the rest did not hold a candle to her (including Harrison Ford & Oscar Issac), so well done miss Ridley, you saved the movie. Special effects and action are all very good, story? well 'aaay ' acceptable - but my beef is mainly else where. I watched this movie at Empire - Leicester Sq. in London, which to my knowledge is the only IMAX-Laser theatre currently in UK. The cinema is supposed to be the state-of- the-art with 4K resolution, 3D and the latest incarnation of IMAX which uses laser- beams to create images brighter than anything before, with better contrast blah- blah. But it failed miserably! I have seen sharper & cleaner pictures from a £500 TV set, Picture was awash with dot-crawl noise, contrast was terrible, motion-judder almost made me sick, and if that was not enough, the crappy 3D-glasses were so hazy, slightest ambient light would turn them gray, destroying any blacks! the space scenes background was not black, it was an annoying gray. Do yourself a favour, watch it on 2D and don't waste your money on IMAX-laser 3D , it is just a hype. Otherwise the movie is watchable, but not great! ---------------------------UPDATE------------------------ Just watched it again on bluray release, and I haven't changed my mind. I still find it ""Not-Good-Enough"" to do justice to previous movies. They need to really concentrate on a STORY first, a movie is nothing without a proper story - re-using previous stories is no good - no matter how much you throw Special-Effects at it. StarWars did not become a classic because of it's special effects alone. Needs a better story teller (as in both writer and director)."
ID_100216	The Franchise we all know and love is back, and guess what? It's BETTER THAN THE PREQUELS! While it doesn't quite top the originals, it comes so close. The movie is so close to perfection! While many will complain the lack of screen time each character gets, everything else works out perfect! The new comers John Boyega and Daisy Ridley are near perfection. There were times when they had a few corny and unfunny lines to deliver, which did not work, but the newcomers do the best job. The casting choice in this one is way better than the prequels. J.J. Abrams does his best to make it like Star Wars and not Star Trek and i think that is what brings this movie to life in so many ways. Everything you knew of the original Star Wars has been brought back to life, and it's as if you are a child again! Sometimes you could never tell what was CGI and what was a costume. The main villain is not only different, but extremely terrifying. I will not spoil anything, but let's just say it was not what you were expecting. All in all, there are some terrific and emotional, breathtaking moments in this film that will go down in the history of the Star Wars franchise. All your favourite characters are back, and it's a breath of fresh air! I am giving this 5/5 stars. May the force be with you. -JayFor my review of The Force Awakens, I will indeed not to give away spoilers to ruin the fun and solid return to roots for the franchise but I will say what I loved about TFA.Firstly, forget the prequels that had surfaced a couple of years back and embrace the continuing saga of the Star Wars universe, taking place at least 30 years after the exciting conclusion of The Return of the Jedi. The story introduces new characters for both from the good side (New Republic) and it's foes (Galactic Empire) and brings back the iconic characters from the original trilogy, sharing some awesome scenes of emotion, full scale action set-pieces, development and even setting the tone for the future episodes VIII and IX.The acting from John Boyega, Daisy Ridley, Oscar Issac, Adam Driver, Domhnall Gleeson and such are all tops, they each give a solid treatment to their roles that enable them to develop further with the plot and set their future roles into the coming episodes.The direction is a solid job well done by J.J. Abrams, who manages to keep not only the original elements of the trilogy but gives a polished refreshing look and tone to the new trilogy that is bound to keep fans and audiences revamp their love for the franchise.Overall, this is the film that will indeed win you over again and again while being labelled as the best instalment of the series to date. Go see it not only once, but multiple times as it's worth the hype and word of mouth.5/5 - Nick
ID_100217	"Context is important to review Star Wars: The Force Awakens. The original Star Wars was an iconic movie of its time and holds fond memories for lots of people from childhood watching the movies, re-enacting the characters and playing with the action figures.As George Lucas found out with the average (at best) prequel trilogy of the late 90's and early 00's, its better not to mess with this nostalgia (recall; bad acting, annoying characters and over-use of CGI, all still fresh in peoples memories). So it was always going to be a balancing act keeping everyone happy by providing something new and fresh but not trampling on legacy and memories.And I think they managed it pretty well.In the secure hands of director J. J. Abrams (why handled the new Star Trek movies very well), we have new and interesting characters in Rey (Daisy Ridley), Poe (Oscar Isaac), Fin (John Boyega) and Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), all acted very well and creating a fresh dynamic in the story.The plot you could argue is pretty formulaic and too close to the original Star Wars, but care has obviously been taken in its making with a nod to the past with revisits of old characters (Han Solo), old equipment (Millennium Falcon) and also a revisit of original production methods, such as the use of puppets in some roles when CGI could easily have been used. To Star Wars fans these small details make a difference.A cynic would say that it is too superficial and not enough fresh ideas or depth, just a ploy to get tickets sold, but for me it was an enjoyable movie with lots of escapism and interesting scenes, great visual effects, and it really did not drag in its length.I'm not a Star Wars buff by any means, but I for one felt more than satisfied having watched this episode.8/10."
ID_100218	I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised by the film. Used to Abrams' horrid bastardizing style, I expected something fit for children and devoid of soul. But since I am not a Star Wars fan and Abrams probably is, I found it acceptable and he probably made more of an effort than when he mauled Star Trek, where the situation is clearly reversed.But what is important to understand right away is that this is not really a sequel. They spend as little time as possible tying the other six films with the story, instead focusing on specific nostalgia bringing moments and catchphrases. Other than that they just rehash Episode IV, the original first movie. It starts on a desert planet, the main character is strong with the force and is good with mechanics, the villain wears a mask and is the apprentice of an evil and ugly looking a-hole, it has a Death Star kind of thing, it is destroyed in the last moment, there are a lot of familial ties that are either pushed down your throat for no good reason of hidden away for a big reveal later on. The only thing missing is an Obi-Wan Kenobi type of guy, dispensing with the training or any kind of explanation of what is going on and replacing it with battle and explosions.Therefore, this is a clear reboot. After all Abrams does the same thing, only better because he probably care about Star Wars a little (sorry, still bitter): he takes a franchise, lists all the good and/or nostalgic points that fans love and shoves them all in his new movie, tying it all with duct tape and special effects.I thought the actors were good, including the new Vader, which some thought was too whiny. Excuse me, have you seen Anakin? Anyway, Adam Driver does a very good job of displaying flaring uncontrolled emotion while behaving in a clear psychotic way. He is not just a misguided soul torn by pain and seduced by dark power, he is clearly deranged and he portrays that very well. The new Luke is quite hot and credible, as much as the plot lets her.A disappointment is the character of Finn, who seems to jump from one personality to another with glee, his only role seemingly to bring the plot in the direction wanted, with no consideration to character consistency. I have nothing with the acting, but the character was almost JarJarish in its randomness. Also Luke...Special effects were top notch, including the battles. Gone are the incompetent stormtroopers who can't hit a target sitting in front of them. They are not competent either, but still. The 3D is also done well and didn't just jump on my face for no reason. Also Luke... (you'll get it when you see the ending of the movie)Bottom line: Abrams reboots Star Wars, trying to take credit for the good stuff others invented before him and brush under the rug the bad things that people hated. He does a reasonable enough job, but while trying to bring realism and technology to the table, he loses part of the magic that the fans were so addicted too. For Star Wars' sake, I hope the sequel will be as good as Empire Strikes back was for Star Wars, otherwise people will just be left with a childish special effect filled clone of the movie that awed their parents.
ID_100219	"I can't believe all of the negative comments coming from people reviewing this movie! As a long time fan of Star Wars, Force Awakens was everything I was hoping the Prequels could have been. In my opinion they did a great job honoring the old characters while also introducing some new and very fascinating people. The story was fun and paid homage to the original movies. To all the idiots bashing JJ Abrams, my words to you are, ""Shame on you!"" For him to take the reigns and be willing to bring the series back probably took some courage!!! Do your self a favor and go see this film. I am going to see it at least a few more times!"
ID_100220	"The saga that enthralled two generations is back to captivate the imagination of a third. A new Star Wars trilogy begins with the much discussed STAR WARS: THE FORCE AWAKENS. Since the classic trilogy, Star Wars has become synonymous with relatable characters in an old fashioned good vs evil story all set to mind blowing special effects, convention defying designs, and a rousing fanfare that kicks off each story set in that galaxy far far away.Under the masterful hand of director JJ Abrams and writer Lawrence Kasdan , THE FORCE AWAKENS pays tribute to the original classic trilogy, recreating iconic scenes, memorable lines and bringing back as many of the classic actors to reprise their roles. Some may say that it is a whole sale copy of A New Hope but there are enough differences and twists to keep things fresh. It is new enough for first time viewers yet Familiar enough without feeling like it is pandering to the existing fanbase. The balance struck is extraordinary! Actors new and old give a stellar performance. Veterans like Harrison Ford slip right back into their classic roles, completely becoming those same characters the old fans knew and loved. The new ones aren't too shabby either with John Boyega as Finn, Daisy Ridley as Rey and Oscar Issac as Poe Dameron turning in magnificently nuanced performances. These, coupled with strong writing and snappy scripting, brings back the naturalistic dialogue of A NEW HOPE, giving us characters that are easy to relate to and well fleshed out. Humour is used sparingly but effectively such that the level of tension and danger is maintained, unlike certain comic book movies where we get a laugh every 5 minutes (I'm looking at you marvel) even though the world is going to end.JJ Abrams was born to direct science fiction. Having honed his craft in two STAR TREK movies, His Free flowing filming style and Long tracking shots make every spaceship scene an exciting roller coaster ride. The audiences weave in and out of battle as gracefully as the starfighters that are blasting away at each other, they run alongside Rey and Finn as enemy TIE fighters fire on them, they are right there in the thick of the lightsaber duels. All this without resorting to the scourge of shaky-cam that so many directors tend to fall back on to ""enhance"" action. Action is large and sweeping in scale with more personal character moments filmed intimately. A balance. For every good balance dictates that there should be a bad. For every hero, a villain. The new villain of Kylo Ren is easily the weakest in the history of black clad STAR WARS antagonists, lacking the menacing presence of Darth Vader, the regal air of Count Dooku, or even manipulative cunning of Palpatine. Kylo is just one angsty angry boy who throws at least two hissy fit tantrums throughout the movie. Maybe it is my age but I find it hard to relate to him as either a tragic antagonist or the next Big bad villain. Adam Diver does his best in the role of Kylo, but he is written Less like a villain and more like an furious fanboy worshiping a famous Long dead individual.Some may not appreciate the seemingly ""safe"" route that the movie takes when it clings to the story beats and mirrors the narrative of the original trilogy. Perhaps they wanted to play it safe after the questionable critical reception of the prequels. After all, familiarity sells and so does nostalgia. The marketing team definitely did their research. I for one did not appreciate a return to the simplistic ""hero's journey"" where good is good and evil is evil. I missed the more complex themes of the prequels and the real world analogies within the narrative of the clone wars and the rise of the empire. But again, this could just be the producers playing it safe. The best part of the movie for me was not the breathtaking special effects or the acting. It was the music by veteran Composer John Williams. From the first notes of that legendary fanfare to the more quieter character centric themes, William's score retains the feel of old school space opera and never caves in to modern movie scoring conventions. He eschews the heavy drums and electronic sounds of recent blockbusters for the traditional brass, strings and woodwinds. The general tone, distinct melodies and some old favourites bring us back to an era where a movie's soundtrack is its own performance that can be enjoyed with or without the movie itself.With all the homages to the older STAR WARS movies, one can really feel that the creative team were fans themselves. That is not to say that this movie would only appeal to fans. On the contrary, it has something for everyone to love, even relative newcomers to the franchise. This is one movie that would definitely have everyone talking about it after the closing credits; reminiscing, recollecting, speculating, and waiting eagerly for the next instalment in the STAR WARS saga."
ID_100221	"Next stop on my Star Wars review series is the start on the new trilogy, The Force Awakens. This may have been the most anticipated film I have ever witnessed and I was so excited before seeing this for the first time in the cinema and now I have rewatched it and this is my review. The premise of the film sees an ex stormtrooper, a scavenger and two smugglers team up in an attempt to stop the new regime The First Order led by a powerful Dark Side user.Main Character
John Boyega plays Finn in this film, a former Stormtrooper who realises his mistakes and decides to leave The First Order and he is great in this film. The guy is just super charismatic in the role making him likeable but also he nails all of his dramatic scenes and he really delivers in making this character really interesting. At this point she was a newcomer but Daisy Ridley plays Rey in this film and she is also great, she is a really interesting character and she goes through a great journey through the film that takes twists and turns that are a bit suprising and a welcome suprise at that. The two's chemistry is very good and very natural making them a likeable pair of leads and great new leads for the franchise.Supporting Characters
Harrison Ford makes his return as Han Solo and he is really good, he is more of a mentor figure in the film and you can tell he has fun in the role. You can tell the version of this character has been through plenty since The Return Of The Jedi and it is told well by Ford as he gives a very good dramatic performance alongside the Han Solo charm. Now we get to possibly the best acting performance at the point of this film Adam Driver as Kylo Ren, I was absolutley enthralled by his performance in this film. He is a villain yes but it is great to see a villain with loads of depth and real drama to him. You can see throughout he struggles between the light and dark side and it did a better job then Anakin's arc in the prequel trilogy in this film alone. Domnhall Gleeson plays General Hux and he is a very good antagonist, he is similar to Tarkin in A New Hope as he plays the evil officer but he is so snivelling and power hungry that it works, I also liked the dynamic between him and Ren and added another side to the film. Oscar Isaac has a smaller but important role as Poe Dameron and he is really good. The chemistry between him and Boyega feels so natural and makes you like them straight away, you can tell he is trying to be the new Han Solo but it works and he is a very likeable person.Story
The story of the film is great, each of the main characters have really interesting plot threads which see their characters start at one point and develop and end somewhere completley different which shows great story structure. Yes this film has gained criticism for having similar plot elements to A New Hope and yeah they are there but I thought it was handled very effectively in this film, and with a film that connects very heavily to the original films it feels appropriate for the film to have a similar structure to that one. I also have to say the film has a great ending that at the time and even now gets you excited for what the sequel might bring.Script
The script for the film is a real positive, one obvious criticism of the prequel trilogy was just how bad the scripts were and how the dialogue made the characters feel like robots or boring but there is no issue with that here. The humour when used works and feels natural, the characters feel like regular people not robots, the drama also nails every level with one of the most emotional moments in Star Wars history happening in this film for sure.Style
The film's style looks fantastic, the action scenes are brilliant and will keep you on the edge of your seat. The lighstaber battle here feels less rehearsed and more personal then the prequels making them feel very intense and really dramatic which honestly I prefer in my lightsaber battles. The pacing of the film feels right and flows between character bits and action sequences really well to keep you interested and excited at the same time.Overall
Overall, I cannot stress how much fun I had watching this film, yes there may be a few small issues but overall my love for this film is huge as it creates a film that tries to move Star Wars forward while paying homage to the past and I think it really succeeds at that.Rating - 10/10."
ID_100222	"Mmmmm... where should we start? Well, falling asleep twice within the first 90 minutes and not even being bothered to see the rest of this movie says a lot. Honestly, I'm short for words! Where is the innovation in this movie, where are the cool actors, and where is the new story line? Rather than calling this movie ""The force awakens"" this movie should have been called ""The force goes to sleep"". The only feeling I got during the first 90 minutes is a deepened feeling of deja-vu! The whole movie is just a rerun of the original Star Wars movie, but with one big difference: lousy acting, even lousier music, and the lousiest lamest story-line (doesn't even deserve the word story) of any movie I have ever seen, literally ever! This feels like Avatar all over again... the coolest 3D animations and special effects, each one worth 10/10, but there it all stopped for me. Is this Disney at its best? Is this really all about making money from preteens? Wow, you guys so under-wow and under- amaze me with this bull-crap. It feels good being able to watch the original Star Wars again (Nope, not part IV for me, but always part I, the only original from 1977). Maybe memories should stay just that... I just hope that someone on this planet can come up with something more interesting, entertaining and exciting than another one of these crappy sequels, because this - for me - has reached the limit of how much more of this nonsense I can take.Where are the next cool producers and directors who are daring to go where no one has gone before (no pun intended)?"
ID_100223	Just came back from a midnight showing in New Plymouth, New Zealand. Have to say I loved it. It didn't feel like an Abrams film. It felt like a Star Wars film. I have grown up with Star Wars. I was nine when I went to the original ( I refuse to call it A New Hope ). Empire Strikes Back is my favourite film of all time and I don't care what the basement detractors say, I liked the prequels and they get an undeserved bad rap. They're movies, they're entertaining, get over it. The Force Awakens has everything you want in a Star Wars movie. The acting was good as was the action and special effects. If you're a fan you owe it to yourself to go see it. If you're a hater you probably still will and then spend the rest of your time on the net complaining how George Lucas raped your childhood and JJ is a hack. Don't listen to the haters go see it for yourself. You won't be disappointed. Footnote. Daisy Ridley sometimes looks scarily like Keira Knightly.
ID_100224	This is a great movie. It's also an extremely popular and mainstream movie, and therefore is going to bring out people that will needlessly nitpick it to death in an attempt to look smart or edgy. There are legitimate criticisms you can hurl at this movie, but people that give it a 1 or 2/10 shouldn't be taken remotely seriously, as they are completely ignoring what the movie did right and putting a magnifying glass over a handful of beyond minor flaws.Star Wars fans will find a lot to love hear. Great set pieces/locations, excellent costume design, flawed and relatable characters, hilarious banter/quips, dramatic and complex relationships, and a ton of space adventure fun. It's the best Star Wars film since Empire, hands down.
ID_100225	"Sadly, not blown away by Force Awakens.Beautiful special fx -- an almost perfect blending of digital and practical elements.Solid casting, throughout. Like the new characters.The story, however, was very safe and very predictable. Too much self reference and regurgitation of previous episodes. Not a bad movie, but it never really ""took off"" to me.I don't want to outright bash the movie, but it's really just ""ok"" - which is the inevitable result of a Disney committee forged product that strives to give fans exactly what they (think) they want, and try to satisfy every possible demographic to make it an eminently consumable product. And that's what it is. Lucas hit it on the head when he basically said ""yeah, people should like it.""You SHOULD LIKE IT. And I do. But I certainly don't love it."
ID_100226	I can't believe it took someone 32 years to make a decent Star Wars movie. Finally, true fan and director J.J. Abrams gave us the film we have desperately been waiting for.The three main new characters were introduced in a great way that we loved them and cared for them in an instant. When any of the original characters showed up, everyone in the theater applauded.Everyone that reprises their role from the original trilogy were perfect, even the new coming leads did a great job.Remember those flashy, coordinated lightsaber duels we got in the previous six Star Wars films? Yeah, forget them cause the fight we got in The Force Awakens was brutal and dirty and excellent.It was everyone's dream to finally see The Millennium Falcon fly again with the use of the new technology of our time. I loved that the film respected the originals by using practical effects instead of special effects all the time (the prequels)Star Wars Episode VII: The Force Awakens is a great start to hopefully another trilogy (The Sequels) and even more Star Wars spin- offs.
ID_100227	"A MOVIE SO STUPID BASED ON STUPIDITY. ""For idiots only"": should have been the advertisement. ""We WANT ONLY YOUR MONEY thanks to your stupidity"" Greedy makes people idiots... so Lucas began to ruin Star wars since the Return of the Jedi with little furry puppets able to face imperial army by arrows and spears. Then Lucas followed with a little child able to destroy a whole separatist frigate with a never managed tiny fighter and a simple shot (note that the ""heroes"" are always invulnerable and luckiest despite of enemies described always as imbeciles). All made to make easy money by marketing which takes advantage from emotional suggestions to sell stupid illusions considering viewer as IDIOTS. Finally Abrams arrived completing the dark plane of the Sith lord: the complete destruction of Star Wars icon so to make easy money selling a fascinating charming absolutely VOID to the dummies.The way to scam people strikes again. (They consider the audience as their own useful idiot to whom selling emotional unreal drugs by a screen in order to accumulate billions of pieces of sheet/sh*t).finally FANsmoney defrauded have DESTROYED STARWARS."
ID_100228	I just seen it in Brussels, right after work.Is this a good star wars movie? yes! Is this a good movie? yes Is this a great star wars movie? definitely yes!Is this a great movie? no, for me not!the good: i enjoyed myself quite a lot with this movie. Its clearly made by fans, for the fans. It feels and breaths star wars.The transition from 'the old' to the 21st century is definitely spot on.The acting is classes above all previous movies combined, yes including the original.I grew up with star wars, loving the movies, but unlike many(not all) fans i can be perfectly critical to the flaws of the original as well.Beyond great and by a landslide the best part of the movie was for sure, the action! the still camera's are replaced by exiting moving camera angles from all sides without ever loosing oversight. things simply looked delicious and total awesome.But since I'm not a 10 year old anymore :) I also manage to approach this in a more critical way then only the fan perspective!There were a few things disappointing to me as this is absolutely not a flawless movie. First of all, without spoilers, this movie is 60-70% just exactly like ' a new hope' strip down all nostalgia and re-introduction of the older characters and whats left of 'new story' material is really really thin, cant help it but i was disappointed about that.I understand the strong importance to connect the new to the old, but this was sometimes trying to be too much 'beying' the old to my personal sentiments. so nostalgic people will of course go nuts,crazy and in full admiration but i have honestly my doubts all adult people specially when not a star wars fan will be equally thrilled.inconsistencies: there are a few , now i know this is the first chapter of a new trilogy, and lots will still need to be explained. But despite that, there are simply a few things that doesn't make any sense at all or where a bit overly charmingly 'star wars' simplified for todays story telling standardsand then final for me the biggest disappointment was the villain!!! By seeing the trailers i had very high hopes, and having a legacy of total bad ass villains ,how could it go wrong? well asides form a few nice tricks this kylo is a total wimp, specially compared to all the previous baddies, he's without spoiling, a confused insecure teenager, struggling with himself, and not this ominous evil unstoppable powerhouse dark force. as what should be the proper decorum for being the baddie of star wars! anyway, non the less, overall, i had great fun, and i can not image star wars fans wont have. it definitely makes many of the high expectations true, and is by a landslide better then all the prequels combined. But is this the best movie I saw this year? no. but recommendable. an honest very fresh review
ID_100229	"Before going into this movie, I was a bit nervous. I did not want this film to be a bit of a disappointment like The Phantom Menace, not saying I hate that movie. After walking out of the IMAX theater, I was amazed. Star Wars Episode VII: The Force Awakens is my favorite film I have ever seen, and I have seen many of the greats. The story takes place, 30 years after the events of Return of the Jedi. The First Order, the new Galactic Empire, is looking for the map that leads to the missing Jedi Knight, Luke Skywalker, while the Resistance is trying to get it as well. First off, the casting is amazing, especially Daisy Ridley, who plays Rey. The story was great, and don't care about ""the plot being too alike to A New Hope"" because pretty much all of the Star Wars plots are like that. The characters were very well thought, especially Kylo Ren. The twist is amazing, not spoiling it. I have no negatives what so ever. Unfortunately, I can only give this film 10, and not higher. I loved it, so I saw it again in IMAX. I highly recommend this film."
ID_100230	At first I thought this movie was going be a dissapoinment and flop big time because star wars is a popular franchise movies that it's impossible to pull off, but jj Abrams proved me wrong.This movie is flat out action packed and just damn brilliantly exciting and totally awesome from start to finish, I love this movie.This movie should of given jj Abrams an oscar nomination for Best director.This movie can never be boring, it does not run-out off energy.For 135 minutes you can't feel the time.The action is pitch perfect.This is a smart clever movie for everybody but better on imax cinemas.
ID_100231	The Star Wars that we know and love is back and better than ever.
ID_100232	When you're taking on this amount of history, or baggage depending on your point of view, you have to start modest and start small and let the story slowly tell itself and fill in the gaps. That's what happens here, as we begin (not unlike SW IV) with a small droid with an important package running into some random (or are they random?) characters. I don't think it's a spoiler to say that along the way Hans Solo and Chewy join the ride and things really start to heat up. As they do the movie pays homage to previous episodes without just redoing what they did before (with one exception). Maybe it's easier just to say what it is - 1) good plot, 2) good characters, best of them Solo, 3) good dialogue, 4) an active story that moves along well, and 5) beautiful scope to the scenery and special effects. What is one of the things that made the original Star Wars so damn good? Scenes like Luke looking wistfully over the desert grandeur of Tatooine. Just reveling for a moment in the spectacle of a foreign world. We got some of that here. What it's not is 1) too over-the-top, 2) too long, or 3) too complicated. Is Abrams to blame for why this is the best SW since Empire? I suspect he is. Real real nice job.
ID_100233	"I have just come back home from the cinema after having spent the evening there with my family watching the new ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"". And I am thrilled, excited and ecstatic.There was a big hype about ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"", and you would have to be living in a cave somewhere if that had eluded you. And no wonder that there was so much hype about it, because director J.J. Abrams did have some rather big shoes to fill out after taking over from legendary George Lucas. And then just how did he manage to do? In my honest opinion, then J.J. Abrams did an amazing job, hand on heart.And having grown up with ""Star Wars"" and loving the franchise, then I was also anticipating the movie and looking forward to seeing what J.J. Abrams would bring to the table. And I think that after the last three movies - parts one, two and three - in the legacy, then it could be nothing but better. And yes, J.J. Abrams succeeded and picked up the torch nicely and continuing in the spirit of the original trilogy - parts four, five and six.Story-wise, then J.J. Abrams was working on the continuation of the last movie ""Star Wars: Return of the Jedi"", and this seventh movie was set 30 years after the defeat of the Empire and the destruction of the second Death Star; being the end of the ""Star Wars: Return of the Jedi"" movie. And while ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" boasts a completely new array of characters, then the return of the core essential characters from the original trilogy (parts four, five and six) return to part seven as well.So just how did these new characters fit into the legacy and the story that J.J. Abrams told in ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens""? Personally, I must admit that I think that the character gallery was amazing, and the talents cast to play the roles were really nicely chosen and were doing really good jobs in bringing the characters to life on the screen. Of course Luke Skywalker (played by Mark Hamill), Han Solo (played by Harrison Ford), Leia Organa (played by Carrie Fisher), C3P0 (played by Anthony Daniels), R2D2 (played by Kenny Baker) and Chewbacca (played by Peter Mayhew) need no introduction. But the new characters introduced in ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" did prove really good and had lots of variety. Rey (played by Daisy Ridley), Finn (played by John Boyega), Poe Dameron (played by Oscar Isaac) and Kylo Ren (played by Adam Driver) did prove to be good characters that will be memorable as those in the original trilogy. However, and yes there is a however, I didn't really think that the villainous Kylo Ren was all that impressive, just seemed like a cheap knock off of Darth Vader, to be honest.And while we are on the topic of the new characters, then I am excited to see the next movies and follow the stories of these newly established characters. But also to follow the continued story of the heroes from the original trilogy.The storyline told in ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" was good, and I had all my hopes and wishes fulfilled by J.J. Abrams's storytelling, and he really did a good job in continuing the timeless space saga. However, there was just too many parallels to the first movies. I mean, a galactic power force that has built a massive weapon capable of destroying planets, and a small force of opposition attempting to foil their plans. It had been done twice already, so on that account, Abrams did leave us hardcore fans with a somewhat dry sensation in our mouths. But the story told around the core characters was good, thrilling and fast-paced. And I think that he managed to incorporate a good many things and details for each individual character and tie them together nicely for a greater picture.And having the special effects team return to physical effects and not rely on CGI as they did in parts one, two and three was a good thing, because they returned to how they worked their magic in parts four, five and six. And the special effects guys really went back to the roots with lots of details, fabulous creatures, great costumes and captured that unique ""Star Wars"" sensation. And boy was that magic back with a vengeance. I was completely blown away with all the details and touches added to this movie. And the space dogfights was just exciting like you wouldn't believe. It was like you were there yourself.Yes, I am a fan of ""Star Wars"", that is no secret and no doubt about it, and it warms my heart to have this glorious return to the original trilogy, and to see it leave the work of George Lucas in parts one, two and three far, far behind in its wake.""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" is exactly what was needed to put new life into the franchise, especially after the massacre the franchise was exposed to with parts one, two and three. And on that account, then J.J. Abrams deserves a massive applause for this accomplishment with this movie. I respectfully salute thee.If you enjoy the ""Star Wars"" saga, then you should embrace ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" with open arms, because it really is a majestic return to the atmosphere and sensation of the original trilogy."
ID_100234	"There is a lot I could write here about this movie but why repeat everything that almost everybody has already said.The best thing you can do is go watch the movie for yourself and make up your own mind; you won't be wasting your money but you may be disappointed.The biggest lesson I learnt from the new star wars movie is just how much hate negative reviews can generate from star wars fans which is kind of ironic really as we all know where hate leads to........and on the flip side of course there are a lot of star wars fans hating the movie too so if we can conclude one thing from this movie it is that JJ is secretly the new Dark Lord of the Sith as he has succeeded in turning so many of you to the dark side...... ;)"
ID_100235	"My score for this film, Star Wars VII - The Force Awakens, is 5/10 maximum. Nothing is original and it is only a pale copy of the first Star Wars IV - A New Hope (1977)The special effects are decent but it almost did it. The scenarios are virtually nonexistent and the story is not new.If the first Star Wars cost $ 11 million, the latest cost 200. This is still 20 times more. Salaries of people do not have as yet increased.In addition, we went to get the fuddy-duddy Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher and Mark Hamill. This has had cost at least 20 million. It is true that on the other hand it changes nothing since in any case all this money will go directly into tax havens and that the stars and the companies attached to this film will not pay any tax as always.They ""gives"" 1 million to ""poor"" to not pay 10, 100 million or 1 billion (companies like Walt Disney) in taxes! Magnificent. We understand who make the laws and for who!No need to waste your money to see this film. The rich are rich enough even if they think otherwise (this is crazy: misers).Get this movie on forums if you really want to see. But again nothing new. Like all the movies coming out of Hollywood these past 10 years (at least) we only see special effects but for history and although they are just good for ants!"
ID_100236	i don't know where to start but all i can say that this movie was amazing and i watched for many time like 6 times and more and my family was like what the hell u only watch it and repeat it many times..soo wht can i say..love star wars and its one of my favorite movies and hope they keep making this for the next level...and
ID_100237	It's a heck of a ride! Loved how they keep the rhythm of the wow going when they keep introducing highlights. This movie has so much significance with regards to linking up from Return of the Jedi. This is easily one of the best from the original 9 movies. Perhaps my only dislike from the movie is how some pieces resemble episode 4.I don't see how you may have missed the movie till now, as it's a historical blockbuster, but if you haven't seen the movie yet, do it! Do it!
ID_100238	Cause i'm sick and tired of a few people who are bashing this movie and the prequels i want to clear that anyone who is a true fan and loves the star wars universe loves all 6 movies the same and now he loves also the new addition to the series.Part 7 is exactly what u expect to see as the dark side comes back with new villains and heroes who fit great with the old stuff we used to know.Most of the original crew is back fitting beautiful with the new crew , the cgi are great and the movie as a whole is A MASTERPIECE.Now for all the devoted fans who are connected to the story and characters u will be moved and never get enough.No spoilers at all so go watch it for the 2nd and third time in a theater and then also get the DVD // blu ray plus whatever u like from the STAR WARS memorabilia.Next year we get the first star wars spin off called rogue one and i can't wait.PS.A word of advise to the haters....bashing this movie u only make us love STAR WARS MORE AND MORE......AND MORE SO STOP ALREADY AND GO TROLLING SOMEWHERE ELSE IN THE BOARDS CAUSE ALL STAR WARS MOVIES ARE GREAT.....NOT JUST FIRST THREE.CRYSTAL LAKE CLEAR.
ID_100239	Loved it! Can't praise it enough Sat there for 2 hours like a little kid on Xmas morningThe new characters are engaging, funny, and human, something I now see that was lacking from the prequelsI'm old enough to remember seeing A New Hope at the cinema when it was first released, I came of the cinema last night with the same sense of excitement.Glad to see that its dong well, and there will be lots more to come I see sadly there are a few folks on this list trolling the film, you guys need to let go of your hate, life is short, you're supposed to suspend your disbelief, let go of your cynicism, and simply enjoy yourself, because if you let this film take you in, its simply stunning.....exciting and emotional...pure good old fashioned escapism...isn't that what it's all about?Well done JJ
ID_100240	The Force Awakens promised a lot and delivered more for both a first time Star Wars viewer or a die hard fan of the series.This movie had all the ingredients of success right from the get go. A captivating opening crawl, fresh characters who were well written and well acted, humor for all ages, relatable heroes and villains, nostalgia moments, and an awesome soundtrack by the incomparable John Williams. It was the first time in over 30 years where we had character development in a Star Wars movie that actually made you care about the heroes you were watching.JJ Abrams had a very tough job in his attempt to basically reboot the series and wipe the terrible impression left by the Prequels on even the most loyal fans. Not only did he succeed, but he actually managed to surpass expectations while providing a perfect balance between old and new, taking big risks with the movie's villain and integrating the new cast with the established heroes. You will care about the characters, you will care about the story, and the ending will leave you craving more while answering some of the most burning questions fans were asking, and at the same time, creating new mysteries and questions to explore in the future.We missed THIS Star Wars, it's great to be back! Thanks JJ, you did it justice!
