ID_100332	If you are not a die-hard Star Wars fan, you won't exactly be amazed with this new episode. A lot of stuff is really predictable and formulaic. It is OK as entertainment. Newer generations will probably get a kick from this, but not someone who liked the first trilogy and is expecting something new here.There was far more drama in previous installations of the franchise, far more powerful scenes, emotional scenes, engaging and more believable characters, dialogue and yes, even fight and action scenes.It is nice to see the old familiar faces again, but that's it. Nothing spectacular or innovative. Abrams is far from Lucas' genius and this can be seen all throughout this film. It is hard to believe that Harrison Ford can't bring out Han Solo properly.If all the other movies that get churned out in these times weren't so utterly bad, I would have given this one even 5/10.
ID_100333	"Thankfully, the Star Wars franchise can get back to fun, and character, and unpredictability. After the durge created by the flaccid prequel trilogy, where there was no emotion, nor effort to wield a lightsaber, and no need to develop personality, it's great to see an unhinged evil character, an uncertain female protagonist, and an awesome droid! Fanboys will obviously lament not having back stories and canon adherence to ""the force"", or that stuffy old men aren't as prolific in this new version, but this is the way forward, not dwelling in the past. Lucas proved he was no director with EPS 1-3, so it is great to have the mantle handed over to film makers."
ID_100334	I make it high 6 only because it is part of STAR WARS franchise. This movie is a remake of New Hope. There was girl (not Jedi) but daughter of Jedi, sand planet, Chewbaca, Solo, princess and new Darth Vader (very weird kind of Darth Vader because looks funny without helmet not scary as everybody expected. Emperor also have silly name Snoke. Like i bad comedy. Fight scene of girl and call it Darth Vader is catastrophe. One regular girl not Jedi girl almost defeated Darth Vader with lightsaber?? Isn't Darth Vader guy with force powers choke? throwing objects telepathic? Story is predictable and very similar with first STAR WARS. I am shocked with high 8 for this movie from film critics. People who wrote pro film critics don't know anymore how to watch movie??? This is worst movie of all Star Wars franchise. And new Rogue 1: a story of Star Wars is much better movie.
ID_100335	I had high expectations from The Force Awakens. Initially I thought that the decision to hand over the SW franchise to a new generation was great. The new faces, the feminist twist and even creating The Force Awakens as a remake of Episode IV were not necessarily bad ideas. They were poorly executed though. I question Disney's choice of movie makers because JJ Abrams did a terrible job with the story, cast, score and pretty much everything. And he has no excuses as I am sure that he had a lofty budget. I also wonder if Lawrence Kasdan wrote the screenplay himself or outsourced it to a 4th grader from an underdeveloped country. It looks like a nauseatingly cheap comic strip with so many gaps in the plot that it almost makes me want my money back from AMC theaters. The new actors are trying hard but are unconvincing, unattractive, and unable to portray chemistry between the characters. The score is painful.I feel sorry for the kids who are supposed to be indoctrinated with this garbage. We grew up with better Stars Wars and probably better dreams. I gave it 3 stars because they brought back Han Solo and Chewbacca although even Harrison Ford cannot save this bad movie. The CGIs were decent too.
ID_100336	Star Wars: The Force Awakens continues with the Star Wars saga created by George Lucas. This movie takes place 32 years after Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi(1983). After the fall of the Galactic Empire, a new threat emerges, calling themselves The First Order. The First Order is led by the villainous, Kylo Ren(Adam Driver). Now, it is up to a couple of unlikely people like, Rey(Daisy Ridley) & Finn(John Boyega), along with the help of Han Solo(Harrison Ford), Chewbacca(Peter Mayhew) & the Resistance to put an end to The First Order & their diabolical plans for the entire galaxy. Star Wars: The Force Awakens is an epic film. Director J.J. Abrams has successfully reintroduced Star Wars to a new generation of viewers. Don't worry, Star Wars fans. Abrams makes sure that this film doesn't lose the essence of Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope(1977), Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back(1980) & Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi(1983) & what made those movies, classics. The special effects are top notch. The 3D puts the viewer, right in the middle of the action on screen. The action set pieces of the film, are one of its many highlights. The 'droid named BB-8 is another highlight of the film. Plot wise, the film has been inspired by Episodes IV, V & VI. However, the script written by, Lawrence Kasdan, J.J. Abrams & Michael Arndt adds many interesting twists & turns so that the viewer feels like this is a brand new Star Wars adventure, while also maintaining the continuity of the previous films. You will feel extremely nostalgic as all your favorite elements of the Star Wars movies are intact. The intro, John Williams' legendary background score, the Millennium Falcon, all your favorite characters & much more. I highly recommend that newcomers should at least watch the Original Trilogy, if they truly want to thoroughly enjoy this movie. The performances are another highlight of the film. Harrison Ford is outstanding as Han Solo. Even after all these years, Ford still has the charm & wit that made Han Solo my favorite character in Star Wars. Daisy Ridley is spectacular as Rey. Ridley portrays the various emotions Rey goes through in the course of the film, effortlessly. John Boyega is superb as Finn. Boyega's portrayal of his conflicted character is commendable. Daisy Ridley & John Boyega make excellent protagonists & can definitely headline more Star Wars movies. Adam Driver is brilliant as Kylo Ren. Though Kylo Ren will never be as iconic to fans as Darth Vader, Driver still gives us an extremely menacing & intimidating antagonist. Carrie Fisher is great as Princess Leia. Oscar Isaac is good as Poe Dameron. Lupita Nyong'o & Andy Serkis are amazing in their performance captured roles of Maz Kanata & Supreme Leader Snoke, respectively. Domnhall Gleeson is impressive as General Hux. Anthony Daniels & Peter Mayhew are fantastic as C-3PO & Chewbacca, respectively. Simon Pegg is hilarious as Unkar Plutt. Gwendoline Christie & Max von Sydow are effective as Captain Phasma & Lor San Tekka, respectively. Last but certainly not the least, Mark Hamill is mind blowing in his brief yet significant role, as Luke Skywalker. The supporting cast are good too. This movie is not just an action packed spectacle. Episode VII is a film with an engaging & emotional story, a generous dose of comedy altogether interspersed with spectacular action set pieces. Star Wars: The Force Awakens is a must watch, especially on the big screen. Can't wait for Star Wars: Episode VIII!
ID_100337	There really is no point trying to do an in depth review of this, it falls in line with a number of series blockbusters that are guaranteed to garner rabid responses, pro and con. The Force Awakens is a film of many flaws, it has a pungent whiff of safeness about it, the charges of it being a glitzy remake are fair enough, while certain plot strands are frustrating and set to be big talking points for years - and years - to come.Yet what about its worth to someone who is not obsessed with every finer detail? Someone who just loves the Star Wars universe as a spectacle prism of entertainment, and has just wanted a Star Wars film worthy of being fit to sit alongside that original trilogy?This made me feel 11 again, took me back to a time in 1977 when I queued for three hours to see such wonders on the big screen. The Force Awakens is, in spite of the recognised flaws, a loving homage to a past love. It's sly with humour and nods to foundations, a blitzkrieg of effects and sound work (my Blu-ray viewing had my sub-woofer doing a jitterbug in the lounge), and it doesn't shy from surprise or the dangling of the carrot.The makers have big heart and technical invention, the cast vibrant, spunky and strongly committed to the cause - the old hands a very reassuring presence - Yeah, so it's not sci-fi perfection, or any Star Wars geeks' idea of the perfect Star Wars movie (oh J.J. Abrams you devil you!), but it made this middle aged guy shed a tear of happiness. A moment to reaffirm why - as a young lad - I fell in love with film in the first place. 9/10
ID_100338	Newer SW movie is still very good and i love it. This movie is maybe little bit worse than previous ones but it's still good.
ID_100339	The most awaited film of the recent times, 'Star Wars: The Force Awakens finally arrived in India today! Being a fan-boy, I treated myself a ticket to celebrate my Xmas inside the cinema. And luckily & expectedly, the seventh installment in the main Star Wars film series, packs a solid punch!'Star Wars: The Force Awakens' is SOLID ENTERTAINMENT. Its a Blockbuster made with passion & ambition. The Writing is crisp, The Direction is tight, The Performances work & The Visual Effects are O-U-T-S-T-A-N-D-I-N-G! In short, The Force Is Stronger Than Ever!'Star Wars: The Force Awakens' Synopsis: Three decades after the defeat of the Galactic Empire, a new threat arises. The First Order attempts to rule the galaxy and only a rag-tag group of heroes can stop them, along with the help of the Resistance.'Star Wars: The Force Awakens' is a Terrific continuation to a legendary, cult legacy. The storyline is packed with several twists & turns, which by the way, offer some extremely shocking moments. I wouldn't want to spoil your fun, but all I can say is, this is the most thrill driven Star Wars flick in ages.J. J. Abrams, Lawrence Kasdan & Michael Arndt's Screenplay is arresting all through. What I loved about the narrative is that, despite the legendary characters who appear here, the story gives scope to newer characters to take the lead & particularly builds a Great Villain in Kylo Ren. And its all because the Writing remains power-packed. A special mention for the wonderfully laced humour. It compliments the goings-on so well! J. J. Abrams has lived his dream. And The Fan-boy in him has left no stone unturned to make a Blockbuster to reckon with. And he delivers, as his Direction remains tight. Dan Mindel's Cinematography is top-class. Mary Jo Markey & Maryann Brandon's Editing is very well-done. Art & Costume Design are excellent. Visual Effects are the highpoint of the enterprise. John Williams's Score is unmatchable, yet again! Performance-Wise: Its such a joy to watch Harrison Ford return as Han Solo. The Legend shines & its indeed a pleasure to watch him kick-ass. Carrie Fisher is back as General Leia Organa & so is Mark Hamill as Luke Skywalker. Their appearances are brief here, but effective. Of the newer cast, Daisy Ridley as Rey, is sensational. The actress shows tremendous potential & performs with enviable confidence. John Boyega as Finn, is lovable & contribute to some of the film's funniest moments. Oscar Isaac as Poe Dameron, is first-rate, as usual. But its Adam Driver turn as the villainous Kylo Ren, who stands out. Driver creates an all-new menace, paying a perfect homage to the Eternal Darth Vader! Domhnall Gleeson as General Hux & The Legendary Max von Sydow as Lor San Tekka, leave a mark, while Lupita Nyong'o as Maz Kanata, provides a superb vocal performance.On the whole, 'Star Wars: The Force Awakens' lives up to the expectations & offers great entertainment. Don't Miss It!
ID_100340	"Two words: loved it.
The feelings I got as a kid? Rekindled. The new characters? Awesome! The old characters? Oh yeah!
The visuals were amazing, the plot got me intrigued. Got no complaints about the acting, it all seemed to fit the individual characters imo.
Out of all of them, Rey definitely got to me the most. Her longing for a place to call home and for people to call her family and belong with is something I can understand, so I felt for her. I thought she was cool on screen, but you should hear my little ones - they were practically gushing about her (still are), and well - that sealed the deal. A new hero has risen.I DIDN'T like the rathtar stuff, but that's all I got for negative stuff. The rest blew me away."
ID_100341	"I had big expectations for this move, partly because of so many positive reviews. Unfortunately it was not a case. And I left puzzled why so many reviews omitted obvious shortcomings of this film.Therefore I offering my emotions free, impartial review, why this film is not such a great deal (unfortunately):1. Completely linear plot. If you expecting to see an unexpected shifts in plot - don't.2. Making old SW clone is bad idea. So many reviews about a ""fuse"" of new and old are embarrassment. This films biggest ""innovations"" are female main character and black trooper. Rest is already experienced old stuff without any innovations. For instance the main battle is almost 100% ""borrowed"" for the old part, so you already know Who, How, and When even before the battle itself.3. No chemistry between actors. Especially visible for Ford and Fisher. In general Ford delivered one of the poorest performance in his carrier.4. Where are the jokes? I agree that film *tries* to produce timely jokes, but there is difference between to try and actually deliver. There was only one joke which was more or less university accepted during my showing.5. Robots are annoying. Really, wholesale beeping is really annoying, likewise another chronically decease of SW - inaccurate and useless ""plastic"" troopers."
ID_100342	The Force Awakens is an Amazing film . It does nearly everything right , the characters are likable , the action is great and the story and music are just great like usual . 9.5/10 A+
ID_100343	"""It's true. All of it. The Dark Side, the Jedi, they're real."" Thirty years after the defeat of Darth Vader and the vanquishing of the dark side not much has changed. A new threat called the First Order has risen with a new leader that is trying to bring back evil to the galaxy. The resistance, along with the First Order are working toward the same objective in hopes that they will be able to win once and for all. The new saga begins with the search for Luke Skywalker. In the last 20 years there have been two movies that have been hyped up to the point of insanity. The first one was The Phantom Menace. After years of waiting the movie turned out to be a tremendous disappointment and took some of the luster off of the series. Once again it is many years later and the hype is at a fever pitch, no movie can live up to that type of hype....except this movie. J.J. Abrams returns the series to an iconic status and starts to rebuild the legacy in ways not seen since the 80's. The movie is essentially review proof but I will say, believe the hype. This is the Star Wars we have been waiting 30 years for. Overall, forget how you felt about the release of the prequels, this is a must watch for any movie fan at all. I highly recommend it. I give it an A."
ID_100344	Daisy earns 10/10 for her intense play. The scenes on her home planet are the best and on par with the ones in 'Hope' as well as Williams' absolutely beautiful 'Scavenger' theme. Finn is a great character and Boyega the perfect actor for it. I like also Drivers subtle performance, he's great as (already very dangerous but still unsure) Vader wannabe. Poe is also a great character and the actor plays the pilot the way I know this optimistic tough guys in reality. the bad guy general as usual in SW has not enough room in the movie to be exposed in depth but is also great play. Snoke was somewhat disappointing but OK.I was a 15 years old when watching the original movie in '78. It changed my live and influenced my choice of profession. But at this time the movie was a revolution. TFA is solid and very entertaining. I can't simply understand why some people are that frustrated. I felt great most of the time even I've missed the simple, dreamy story development of 'Hope'. But this times will never come back. Today everything is fast paced. And considering the way movies are made today, under pressure of a big company, this is perhaps the best we can get.I'm looking forward to see great scenes and moments when Rey will be teached by Luke in EP VIII. This two exceptional actors together will be able to create a remarkable moment in movie history. I hope the director and the script are able too. And Disney: go for risks! Send your marketing guys on vacations for the next release! We don't need a death star like thing twenty time bigger in there! Let the force flow through you...
ID_100345	This hit all my nostalgia buttons...every single one of them...BUTC'mon its a complete remake of New Hope with a bonus gender switch.
ID_100346	I have read a lot of the negative comments about TFA. Mainly I see comments like: too much like the original, not enough plot, etc. It also seems some have a problem with a female lead who is strong and powerful with the force. I go to the movies to be entertained and boy was I entertained. J.J. Abrams has brought SW back to what it was originally...action packed, character based, energetic fun. Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, Oscar Isaac, and Adam Driver are absolutely fabulous as new characters and I look forward to seeing them develop in the next 2 films. There are many unanswered questions as the curtain closes on this Episode. I eagerly await the answers.
ID_100347	I got a thrill from the Star Wars opening theme. But as the movie continued it seemed like more than the opening was similar to the 1977 original. You would think trained storm troopers would not be so scatter-shot, however one of the main characters actually got hit!! Alas, it was a mere flesh wound. Don't you think you or I could hit something - anything - with a blaster? Oh well, a space opera needs it's heroes. The villain of the movie would have been more menacing had he kept the mask on until the death scene. Young love is expected in movies like this - old love is pathetic. Good thing they don't dwell on that too much. Nice to see all the originals again. I was sorry to see the ex trooper healing in bed - he was awkward in his role. Not as bad as Jar Jar Binks, but had a Wesley Crusher feel. Given his prior job on a death star that big he would have no chance at all to have the knowledge he imparted. Better to give him a hero's death. Senator, he's no Hans Solo. The new women lead was very very good. Better than a young Luke.
ID_100348	Star Wars: The Force Awakens is directed by J.J. Abrams and stars Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, Adam Driver, Harrison Ford, and Domhnall Gleeson. First off, I won't say much about the plot because in the marketing you don't know much about, all for the good reason. It's mostly about Rey( Daisy Ridley) who's a scavenger meets up with a renegade stromtrooper( John Boyega) and from there, it's an adventure. Now the acting was a little worried because Daisy Ridley and John Boyega haven't done any big movies but I have to say they were both fantastic. John Boyage was great but Daisy Ridley stole the whole movie. Harrison Ford was amazing. He wasn't just doing the movie, he was Han Solo. Adam Driver played Kylo Ren amazing, one of the best villains in Star Wars universe yet. The action scenes were great too. The lightsaber fights seemed real and it emotion to them. Now some negatives that people might have with The Force Awakens is that it repeats a lot that happened in the first Star Wars( A new hope) but to me it didn't bother me, sometimes it stands out but I didn't care, everything was amazing it truly felt like a Star Wars movie. Overall Star Wars: The Force Awakens was a fantastic movie, had that emotion like the original Trilogy had and brought new things into. The acting, action, visuals, everything was done so well. Great job J.J. Abrams
ID_100349	It starts well but it soon suffers from less creative dialogues, jokes at inappropriate moments or scenes that could be completely cut with no impact on the story. And the plot itself is the in my opinion the weakness of the movie.Spoiler alert: Just the ex trooper tells a new thing, and I liked how the son kills his father. The kill does not have to be heroic in my opinion, it feels authentic and was one moment which I didn't expect. The rest is neither surprising nor innovative. It is entertaining of course with nice effects but I expected more from another, new Star Wars episode.
ID_100350	By all accounts, this film really shouldn't work as well as it does. Looking at it in the cold light of day it is essentially a repeat of the original film in terms of narrative – albeit with some details changed and all the characters moved sideways by a generation. So we have the same parent/child divide, the same innocent discovering their power, right down to the same finale with a large planet-sized weapon. Associated with this it also rides very heavily on nostalgia and brand recognition so that we probably accept a lot of plotting conveniences that we would scoff at in a film we came into cold. However, even seeing all these things, it is hard not to love it for how well it works.It does this by getting the balanced right between all the many aspects that the film seeks to pull together. So we have the nostalgia and a very familiar narrative, but at the same time we have a story that is delivered in a way that engages and is surprisingly moving at times (albeit due to that self-same nostalgia and reliance on us already being invested in this universe and the characters). It also manages to be fun but yet also able to transition into darker moments without one damaging our enjoyment of the other. This is what makes it work I think – because it is really an enjoyable film to watch. It never really stops moving, and the characters are rather thin, but within this frame they work and are engaging.The cast are a big part of that, and it is a very well-cast piece given that the new faces are not dominated by the old familiar ones. Boyega makes good on that charisma he showed when playing the lead in Attach the Block, while Ridley is really natural and likable. For all the fuss over a black storm trooper and a female 'Luke', the truth is that both do a great job regardless of race/color – but do bring that extra factor into play (I had a daughter recently, and it did rather focus my mind on the deficient of strong female characters who are played for themselves, not for their sexuality). The cast is deep in familiar faces and really everyone is on good form – Fisher perhaps seems there because she has to be, but it was nice to see Ford manage to have a bit of a twinkle back in his eyes. The volume of familiar faces in tiny roles does get a bit distracting (particularly if you have watched any shows from Abrams and know his usual cast) but this is a minor thing since the film otherwise does a very good job of keeping you with it for all its adventure and fun.Such a hyped film with such weight on its shoulders really shouldn't be able to be so light on its feet while also delivering dramatic and emotional moments, but it does. A really enjoyable Star Wars film that delivers a lot – and regardless what George Lucas thinks, it has been a very long time since that was the case.
ID_100351	I do not understand the hate this movie has received. The critics are great. This is, very simply, a great movie. Very well-made.
ID_100352	If you ever thought that the magic of Star Wars was lost, then think again, because The Force Awakens marks a triumphant return for the series. Filled to the brim with some of the most spectacular action of the series, fascinating new characters, brilliant dialogue and stunning visuals, this is pretty much as enjoyable as Star Wars can get.The film follows the journey of Rey and Finn as they are introduced to the world of the Resistance and the First Order, as well as the legend of the war between the Rebels and the Empire. The two are both hugely intriguing characters, each with their own original backgrounds and completely convincing and fascinating motivations that makes them an absolute joy to watch.That's helped by the two stunning performances given here. John Boyega, as Finn, proves his worth not only as a great action hero, but a fantastic actor, as he gives a massively entertaining and energetic performance that you can't help but love.However, the real stand-out from this movie is the performance by Daisy Ridley, which is phenomenal. She's absolutely stunning in the action sequences, and holds her own in the dialogue sequences against veterans like Harrison Ford. She plays her character, Rey, with such clear excitement, and has immediately stamped her authority as one of the greatest on-screen presences in the entire Star Wars saga.Moving on, we've got to talk about J.J. Abrams' direction and the visual effects. There has been so much talk about the use of practical effects here, and I can tell you that it all comes to life perfectly. Mixed in with breathtaking CGI, this is most likely the most beautiful-looking Star Wars movie of all, and it's an absolute wonder to watch unfold at every moment, a real triumph in comparison to the lacklustre directing of the prequels.The only flaw that I do have with this film is in its story. Throughout, it's a hugely entertaining watch, and does almost everything that we expect from Star Wars, but what it doesn't manage is to be a non-stop thrill-ride.The first act, however, is astonishing, and features exhilarating action sequences, as well as hilarious and brilliantly-written dialogue, and easily compares to the best moments of the original trilogy.Although, as the film progresses, we lose the originality and thrill of the first act. The plot focus slightly begins to lose its way in the second act, and the third act, despite being full of incredible emotional drama and great action, just isn't as impressive, and unfortunately feels like a slight copy of the greatest moments from A New Hope.Of course, a film doesn't have to be non-stop action all the way through, as The Empire Strikes Back proved, however there are moments where this can drag a little, and it didn't quite deliver either the intrigue or fun excitement that I really wanted.Overall, though, The Force Awakens is a thrilling rebirth for the Star Wars saga, and one that will definitely go down as a great action film, a beautiful visual spectacle, and a breakthrough for two brilliant young actors, and although its plot often leaves a little more to be desired, it's still an absolutely fantastic film.
ID_100353	I should probably say this now, I've never been a Star Wars fan. I like certain aspects of the movies but as a whole, they are way overrated in my eyes. So it should come to no surprise I found the new movie rather tepid. Again, the movie had it's moments of great action, lightsaber battles, and uses of the force, but outside of those moments, the magic wasn't there.Nothing felt new in the sense that this was supposed to be the movie to reinvigorate the franchise. It felt like a total retread of the first movie from 1977. Yes, it had new characters and a slightly new mythos, but everything else was more of the same. The Force Awakens was trying to be nothing more than nostalgia, which is bittersweet. It succeeded as such which will please fans of the original three but at the same time, nothing new was offered, nothing except future promises. It was nice to see old characters and their introductions, but it was borderline too much. Had the movie introduced them then put them on the back burners, we could be talking about something different, but that wasn't the case. It is hard not to talk about specific beats without spoiling the movie. Even the mighty soundtrack by John Williams was borderline the exact same thing as the original, yes it is nice to see it appear once again, but this is a new generation, something new must be offered.That's not to say everything was about the movie, the young new characters seem like a great new addition. Only time will tell how well they develop and fit in within the Star Wars universe. Not to mention they are a driving force behind the great comedic moments in the movie. This was something that was unexpected yet very welcome. The movie has made promises (Mockingjay Part 1 anyone?) so only time will tell where we head from here. But as of now, all these new characters are just treading water waiting for their time to truly take over the franchise.Yes, the movie will break box office records and fans will rejoice the franchise is back. But with the promises of an unknown amount of sequels the franchise will have a difficult time maintaining the stakes at hand. So at the end of the day, it really comes down to the following, is this something I want to rewatch? Something that demands to be seen multiple times because of its greatness? The answer, sadly, is no.
ID_100354	Just got back from a pretty early showing in Manila. The real winner here was the production design and art direction which beautifully created an up to date version of the star wars universe whilst lovingly staying faithful to everything from the earliest movies. Together with the awesome special effects and locations the movie looked stunning. Unfortunately the story and the concepts in the movie just really felt like a remake of episode iv (the original 77 movie). Many of the key elements were simply redone. As for twists and turns just think of any long running soap and you'll have an idea. The music also had some nice new pieces mingled in with the main themes. Basically this is Disney star wars nostalgia and we'll never get tired of whatever is dished up. In the same way as the 007 franchise, we will whine a little and then continue to watch the next one. Just the music themes and the sound of droids bleeping, phasers blasting, and dark lords breathing heavy will give us a rush no matter what.
ID_100355	"I wrote a review for the prequels saying that maybe George Lucas made a mistake using current world affairs as a means to tell how Star Wars came to be; trade negotiations, the war on terrorism, and the rise of imperialism in the government. But they were his mistakes to make in his legacy. But I accepted the prequels. I grew up with Star Wars. In fact, my family still has the home video recordings from when the originals aired on HBO in the 80's and I'm standing by those instead of the 2000 upgrades. As for TFA, I'm standing by it because I believe J.J. Abrams has gone back to the roots of Star Wars: good vs. evil. Before I went to see it, I asked my brother one question, 'Is there a preview scene after the credits?' I didn't want any spoilers or hints and he didn't have anything bad to say about it either."
ID_100356	"After reading some of the reviews here, I am really glad I wasn't the only one extremely disappointed when seeing this so called ""movie"". I was SO excited to see this movie. The trailers got me hooked, it looked EPIC and after watching some of the red carpet event and reading the reviews saying things like ""JJ pulled it off"" and ""This is the best Star Wars since The Empire Strikes Back"", my expectations were even higher. But within minutes of watching it, I was devastated. Something just didn't feel right from the beginning. I kept thinking this has to be a joke, that I was in a parody of the movie I paid to see. This movie is NOT a Star Wars movie, this is a Disney movie made for kids. Everything felt SO rushed with no character development and full of plot holes. Most of my friends and family were extremely disappointed as well. I hope the next director can do better, although I doubt it because Disney holds the key and will not unlock it for anyone to do anything original. Disney killed The Avengers and now Star Wars. I will no longer support Disney in any way. I will just pretend that this movie never existed and watch the other movies instead."
ID_100357	"It took me a long time to write reviews again, which is fair, because I have been going through a bit of a block lately. Since it's the first day of a new year, I guess it's fair that the first review I write of this year is last year's (actually, it came out three weeks ago) biggest hit. To be honest, I didn't expect ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" to crawl deep inside my brain and bring me back into the world of space that I remembered when I was a kid. Mainly, because I lost touch of it for a while. I wasn't born in 1977, but I remember seeing two of the three original ""Star Wars"" movies with my dad when it was re- released in 1997. Now after re-watching all 6 episodes of the Star Wars saga after seeing ""Force"", I realized that this was a world (or worlds) I couldn't leave behind. So, what's new this time? Well, Disney took over Lucasfilm, George Lucas is still retired, and it looks like the beginning of the new trilogy can definitely return to the flavor of the much-loved original trilogy (the prequel trilogy still remains quite divisive among fans). Now taken over by J.J. Abrams (director of ""Star Trek"" and its following sequel), ""The Force Awakens"" is a wonderful, exhilarating, funny, triumphant, sometimes tragic and beautifully imaginative adventure that reminded me and a lot of people who have already seen it how much we've loved and missed ""Star Wars"". We cheer for the heroes, hiss at the bad and we feel for the ones that are in-between. Plus, we get to experience worlds that Lucas and company has created 39 years ago and it still remains as vibrant and colorful and thrilling as ever. Whether you missed out or live in a cave (I don't think you're one of those people, because you've already seen the movie more than once), let me try to explain a bit of the plot without spoiling it. Set three decades after the events of ""Return of the Jedi"", a fellow Jedi that we all know and love has disappeared and the evil Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) is hell-bent on finding him and getting rid of him. Meanwhile, we get to meet some impressive new characters. Rey (Daisy Ridley) is a scavenger from Jakku who has been for looking for her family ever since she was a little girl. Finn (John Boyega from ""Attack the Block"") is a Stormtrooper who has been ripped from his family and has been sent to kill but manages to turn the other corner, as it is. Finally, there's Poe (Oscar Isaac from ""Ex Machina"" and ""Inside Llewyn Davis"") who's a pilot. Oh, wait, there's also a new droid on the scene. Its name is BB-8, who is quite friendly and helpful in every way. Joined together quite late in the process, they team up with returning characters Han Solo (Harrison Ford), General Leia (Carrie Fisher) and, of course, our favorite Wookie, Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew) in order the find the missing Jedi and to take down the First Order led by Supreme Leader Snoke (Our mo-cap superstar Andy Serkis), Ren and General Hux (Domhnall Gleeson, also from ""Ex Machina""). I was ever so reluctant to see another episode of ""Star Wars"", but after seeing it, it renewed my interest in the world of both filmmaking and ""Star Wars"". It looks as if Abrams has accomplished what Lucas did in the past, recreating the magic as if it still existed. Characters, galaxies, secrets, epic battles and plentiful twists and turns that never diminished of what Lucas had envisioned before. The only glue that remains as a big piece of the puzzle is the always unforgettable score done by John Williams. With the iconic opening theme and a few additional themes added in there as well, Williams once again creates another bit of lightning in a bottle. Nothing moved me more as I got to see Solo and Leia together again, as well as our original droids, C-3PO and R2D2. (Mark Hamill is also in here as well, but I can't reveal where he's at.) Plus the new characters are brilliantly cast. Newcomer Daisy Ridley is a star I definitely should keep my eye on. I even liked her chemistry with John Boyega, who is both heartfelt and humorous at certain turns. We don't get to see much of Poe in the movie, but Oscar Isaac brings a warm and dashing impression. But the standouts are definitely Adam Driver who brings a lot of terror and emotional depth as Kylo Ren and (obviously) Harrison Ford as Solo. This character that we loved for so long is charming, energetic and ruggedly laid-back as ever and Ford continues to make that character totally rewarding. This is a movie event I will never forget (next to ""Jurassic World"", it's easy not to overlook this). All I can say is this: I can't wait to see what Rian Johnson (director of ""Looper"" and ""Brick"") and Colin Trevorrow (director of ""Jurassic World"") can do with Episodes 8 (coming 2017) & 9 (coming 2019), because this is a fantastic saga that shouldn't be forgotten. The ""Star Wars"" saga still remains a amazing group of films that if you watch from the very beginning (I always start with Episodes I-III then Episodes IV-VI), you can see that the story still connects one way or another. I certainly hope to see this movie again. Probably because I want to pick up on some of the hidden secrets that are hinted at. Also, I want to be overwhelmed by the amazing visuals, memorable characters and incredible worlds. Another ingredient to add into this is that the Force has been passed down from one generation to another. With ""The Force Awakens"", it just shows that the force is definitely with us, forever and always. And I'm glad that I got to be a part of it again."
ID_100358	I will warn you all now that I am a little bit biased when it comes to Star Wars. But not even I can fully defend the prequel trilogy. There were some good moments in and acting them (McGregor for one). But they were in essence just about trying to tell us what we already knew i.e. that Darth Vader was going to the dark side. Not much more was gained than that unfortunately.So 32 years after what I would consider the last really good star wars film (Return of the Jedi), The Force Awakens(TFA) has been released, but is it actually any good. Well from my already stated viewpoint (A bit biased) I would say it was absolutely brilliant. I will not give any spoilers away today. Another review will be coming next week after my 2nd viewing. So this review will just cover basics about the Director, cast etc.When I heard that J.J. Abrams was hired as the director I was very happy. Though some people (Mainly Trekkies) did not like his take on Star Trek, I thought they were very good re-envisioned films. I also like most of what he did on Lost. You can tell he decided to make the films as Lucas did with the original films and should have done the prequels i.e. with some TLC. From having an actual Millennium Falcon built to using actual locations as per the original and not all CGI led. Most importantly, He hired Lawrence Kasdan (responsible for scripting Empire Strike Back), this was a master stroke as this guy knows how to write a good script. The vistas are also beautiful thanks to cinematographer Daniel Mindel.The sound effects and the score (John Williams) is as ever brilliant. In fact Williams score is one of the things that is great about the prequels and he does not disappoint again here and is one area that may get an Oscar nod along with special effects and cinematography.The most important part (along with the script) Abram's had to play along with the producers was to hire a good cast. This is an area I was very worried about as Lucas got this very wrong with his main character on 2 occasions in the prequels. Both Jake Lloyd and Hayden Christensen were poor as Anakin. Here in TFA there are lots of new characters, so trying to blend them all in with the older established characters (Han, Leia et al), would not be an easy task.I am very happy to say that casting is not an issue. From 2 young British actors in Daisy Ridley and John Boyega (Attack the Block) as well as Oscar Isaac (Ex Machina), to the more established Ford and Fisher. They even manage to fit in a General Hux (Domhnall Gleeson (also Ex Machina and Harry Potter)), to keep me happy.It is plain to see that there is brilliant chemistry between the cast, it is difficult to fake that on-screen. I have sometimes found Ford looking disinterested in recent roles, but there must be something about the role of Solo that has brought the best out in him again as he was excellent, he with Ridley and Boyega are the stand-outs for me (On the Light-side anyway). Though Isaac is again brilliant as he in most of his films. One final mention has to also go to Adam Driver as Kylo Ren (TFA's villain), I will go more into his performance in part two if this review next week. But suffice to say he is an excellent heir to Vader and he also has a great lightsaber :). I would highly recommend going to the to see this (Though maybe not at midnight), its one of those films that needs to be seen in the cinema. It is a fun thrill ride of a movie with all the right Star Wars ingredients. Yes it does pander a little bit to fans (That's the only spoiler I will give), but there is plenty here for all to enjoy and love. The one issue you may have is you will most likely have to have seen the original trilogy before coming to see this (If you haven't already).
ID_100359	This movie is the Star Wars sequel we needed! Perfect sequel of where the old movies ended. A new generation, a new threat, a new adventure!
ID_100360	Star Wars Episode VII The Force Awakens focuses on Nostalgia of the original trilogy using elements and aspects from the original trilogy to introduce both old and new characters. The original storyline parts mesh well with borrowed aspects, Disney played safe for sure when making the movie, regardless it came out well. Although some of the new acting choices are questionable, its still an enjoyable beginning of a new trilogy.Both new and old Star Wars fans will enjoy this new addition to the Star Wars universe.
