ID_100121	I feel like writers and directors who are attached to big name revivals of some of histories greatest cinematic entries, don't even bother to watch the originals and try to improve upon them.This movie, without adding a bunch of spoilers, barely... and i mean BARELY... separates itself from the previous entries in this movie, by failing to come up with anything original in the Star Wars universe. JJ Abrams (although I'm sure he put a lot of effort into this film) smashes his style into as much of the opening 15 minutes of this movie as possible (with lens flares galore), and perhaps due to advice from his studio, tones it down and tries to match the feel and nostalgia of the originals for the remainder of the film. He didn't succeed.Plot wise, the whole film is a carbon copy of Episode 4: A New Hope event for event. There are VERY few original scenes, even though I know a few were trying to pay homage to the first three films (like the canteen for instance), and the giant star-killer death-star planet thingy, but couldn't they have finally gone in a different direction? . Why copy something when you can inspire a new and different understanding? The only thing that makes this movie different at all is the dialogue, but there are so many terrible holes in the plot, unexplained scene changes and co-incidental events, that true fans will be frustrated by the end of this film.Personally, I found the characters in this movie much too similar to others from the series. Many of the new characters are just recycled husks from the previous films. The lead, a young girl stranded on a desert planet, hoping to one day leave and find her purpose (change the gender, and there's Luke), a young man struggling with the dark side within himself and sides with the imperialists (Ren literally trying to be Anakin throughout the film), a loud mouthed cocky fighter pilot (a Han wannabee), and of course there has got to be some comic relief, so they give us an imperial janitor turned soldier, who has plenty of attitude and stumbles his way through most of the battles (Finn = the new Jar Jar).Criticism aside, I'm sure people will think I'm being harsh, but think about this: The original trilogy was something that has lasted the test of time, and the prequels (although some are terrible) are still Lucas's story. This film is something else entirely. Another director with permission to tell another man's story... and it feels exactly like it. A version of events told by someone who wasn't there, rather than from the witness himself. Like when your best friend tells you a story you told him only the week before. You smile, but you also want to punch him in the face for stealing it. Abrams bring nothing new in this film, when he could have focused more than just the plight of the Rebelion again.This movie is only slightly better than Phantom Menace, and that's as good as I'm willing to go with this one. I certainly didn't leave the theater with the sense of excitement to see the next instalment in 2017...but I'll watch it, of course...6/10
ID_100122	For one of the most anticipated movies of all time its quite hard not to get overly excited for the newest edition for the Star Wars universe!With JJ Abrams at the helm of the latest release and with the majority of the original cast returning, there are ridiculously high bars set for this one - and understandably so!JJ does a great job at not going too over the top with graphics, instead opting for realistic props, characters and worlds. Nevertheless it is inevitable that some computer graphics are used - and there a quite a few new tricks that we have never seen in the Star Wars universe that get put into great effect in this release! I must say that whilst some people speculated that this would be a movie purely of lens flares...they have been mistaken. There is and will never be nothing like the opening credits which take us through what has happened over the last 30 years. A hotly debated and anticipated plot revealed, I think that they have done exactly what has been needed. Something new, together with something old - and nothing of something stupid.Having some of the original cast together with some great new talent really refreshed the story and helped to breathe fresh life into the franchise that we all love and care about.As I don't really believe in spoilers, I will simply say this - if you've been eagerly anticipating this movie and can't think of a better thing happening in your life... or if you are a low-mid level star wars fan, or even if you are new to the franchise - I think JJ has done a great job with Star Wars: The Force Awakens as there is something that will appeal to all members of the audience - whether you know any of the original story or not. You will not leave this movie feeling dissatisfied with all of the hype, media and the personal feelings of ultra-excitement that has surrounded it. In fact, at a bare minimum I would say I walked away thinking - now that, was worth the wait, worth the price and worth my time. If you walk away from this movie unsatisfied you have probably tried to look too far into this with plot lines and an already sour taste from the prequels (if you disliked them). If you are not a fan and didn't like all the excitement then I would ask - why did you even go and see the movie? You could have left a seat for somebody who would have appreciated the artwork that has been put together!All in all, this is as a standalone movie - seriously great. As part of the new trilogy - an excellent platform, and as part of the Star Wars Universe - a fresh, new and exciting addition. Well done to JJ Abrams and to all the cast and crew for once again, bringing all of the ideals and emotions you can expect with a real Star Wars movie - plus a couple of new tricks!
ID_100123	The single piece of laziest story telling i have ever seen in my life..If this is the new standard for Hollywood, then it's utterly disgusting..The story was pitifully bad...The characters were pointless and shallow..It was a dumb mary sue propaganda video with a few special effects thrown in..Disney and Abrams should be ashamed of themselves...This was a really bad ''any kind'' of movie. Let alone a good star wars movie...I bet the ones that hated on the prequels want to beg Lucas to direct the future movies now...DO NOT SEE THE NEXT MOVIE AT THE CINEMA OR Hollywood WON'T GET THE MESSAGE...ALSO..DO NOT BELIEVE TRAILERS..THEY JUST MAKE YOU THINK THE MOVIE WILL BE GOOD..IT'S CALLED HYPE, AND THE WORLD GOT CONNED BIG TIME WITH THIS GARBAGE.
ID_100124	"I have never been a huge fan of the Star Wars films--especially after the last three films they made. Too often, in my opinion, the emphasis was merchandising cute characters to kids instead of making the best possible sci-fi film. Fortunately, now that George Lucas sold off the franchise, Disney actually has made a slightly darker and slightly more adult addition to the franchise...and I was thoroughly impressed.I really DON'T want to talk about the plot of ""The Force Awakens""-- mostly because the movie just debuted and I would prefer folks experience it themselves. However, I don't think it spoils it in any way to say that the film is a bit of the old and a bit of the new. So, folks who loved the earlier films (particularly the great ones) will be happy that the film is clearly Star Wars and has a lot of similar plot elements from the earlier movies. You also get to see some familiar faces. But there also are several new ones and they seem to have a bit more depth than usual. I particularly liked Finn (John Boyega) and Rey (Daisy Ridley)--they were not just formulaic characters and you really like and respect them.The bottom line is that the film very much kept my interest and Disney seemed much more focused on story and, especially, characterization. A thoroughly enjoyable film from start to finish."
ID_100125	First off, to those people who think that this is just a remake of A New Hope, it most certainly isn't. There are similar contrasts to it in parts, but in all honesty, isn't that what we all wanted? Everyone loves the Original Trilogy so much, why should we complain if there are some similarities? That doesn't make any sense to me. These people were just expecting too much in my opinion. They cannot be pleased with anything.I went in with high expectations, and I was blown away. It brought back everything I loved about the original movies. It was fantastic. Rey (Daisy Ridley) is amazing, and I'm excited to see her story continue in Episode VIII. I loved all of the characters actually (Finn, Poe and Kylo Ren were especially great). I thought the action scenes were spectacular. Disney really nailed it with this film.I was never a huge Star Wars fan before this film. I love the first films, but the prequel movies were lackluster at best. This film made me interested in this whole universe. I'm so excited to see what's to come. Kylo Ren and Rey have so much potential to be outstanding characters that'll be remembered forever. I'm incredibly excited for what's to come. 10/10.
ID_100126	"I don't know what it is, but it just seems like the soul of the Star Wars universe is missing. There is an emptiness that was only emphasized by killing off one of the main characters. It was almost like the director knew something was missing, and had to do this dramatic stunt just to make a surprise/shocking ending to add some sort of life to this shallow film.It's an empty shell trying to galvanize itself to something greater. If the next movie somehow (miraculously) pulls all of this together (and possibly brings the deceased character back to life) they might be able to continue the series. Otherwise, it's just another MockingJay imo.The good news is, at least there is a story. Is it important enough to extend the series by three or four more films? It all depends on the next movie. If they blow it in the next film, it's over. In fact, they may actually kill the entire franchise if they pull another ""Force Awakens"". I feel like I've lost interest in the whole franchise after watching this attempt.This may seem a little harsh, but I just watched the film, and I am expressing my first impressions precisely. The new younger characters are okay, but not even close to the caliber of Ford, Hamill, Fisher. Maybe it's a problem with what this generation produces and accepts (like Hunger games et al). Shallow is the best way to describe it. And, second-rate seems to be good enough for some evidently."
ID_100127	"""Star Wars: The force awakens"" could easily be retitled ""Star Wars: The next generation"" because this long time coming sequel to the original trilogy introduces a new cast of characters, as well as some familiar ones. Providing a lot of fan service to those who've seen the original trilogy, those who see this new chapter in the franchise will find a lot of this fan service goes over their head if they haven't caught up with the original trilogy (a cynic might say that the movie is a rehash though). It seems pitched at a young audience at times ('cute' new robots etc.) but occasionally I'd say that the action is more suitable to young teenagers.I'll refrain from giving away too many details about this movie, apart from the basic plot concerning the search for Luke Skywalker (the hero of the original trilogy) in order to restore ""balance to the force""...or some such. Becoming a key player in the search for Luke is our heroine, young Rey (played by Daisy Ridley). She's not far from being this movie's analogue to Luke Skywalker in the original trilogy, as in it seems to be her journey that we will be following the most, although other new characters are a focus of this movie. Rey comes across as potentially a character to root for but I'm not convinced that the story or script has done Daisy any justice in accomplishing this.Towards the end of the movie, it was tracking to score 60% but I quite liked the last 30 odd minutes of this movie and so pushed my score up to 65%. You can tell from that score that this movie didn't really excite me that much. Maybe that is due to it being a recycling of story and references from the original movie? No, not that. Here's my biggest fault for this film: it's designed to push your buttons, to manipulate you into a state of euphoria...and fails. It's this failure which sees my score so low. In other words, I don't have a problem with movies trying to push your buttons or to manipulate you...but please, just be good at what you're trying to do!The brand is strong with this one, though, as worldwide box office receipts are showing. Maybe this movie could become the highest grossing movie of all time...or enter the top 5 or even top 3 spots. That it's having this impact speaks volumes for the work of George Lucas, whose first movie in this franchise (""Star Wars: A new hope"", which is episode IV in the series!) created the ""Star Wars"" brand, from nothing. If that film had bombed at the box office, we'd have heard no more of this space opera. Maybe I'm nostalgic for the original trilogy and this colours my views on the revival of this franchise by Disney Inc.? I doubt it. Ordinarily, I don't see movies more than once, but I have returned to the original trilogy more than I have for most other movies (from memory, I've seen the first ever Star Wars movie maybe about half a dozen times or so). To tell you the truth, the prequels to Star Wars I've only ever seen once. They were that mediocre. ""The force awakens"" is roughly in the same league as the very last of the Star Wars prequels, and that was the only good one in that prequel trilogy. That being said, I can't imagine returning to this current movie. If this current movie repeats its founding movie's status as the highest grossing movie of all time, will it have the same repeat viewing value? THAT is the test of its worth, in my view. Lacks that, it does. Reminds me of those reports about blind taste test between various colas...when you know you're drinking Coke, you rate it the best, but when blindfolded, you prefer the taste of other colas...not even brand names, necessarily. I suspect that that's the case with this new Star Wars movie...the brand is selling it.The movie walks a tightrope between being ponderous (and therefore uninteresting) and intending to be euphoric with its action. Characters are 'hothoused' (like Rey) and not allowed to grow as characters over time. Other characters are foisted upon us with metaphorical cardboard signs around their necks, telling us how to relate to them. E.g. one X-wing fighter pilot is spotlighted as being ""the best pilot in the resistance"". As if we couldn't be SHOWN that. And what I did see wasn't that remarkable. There's a huge contrast between this tightrope balancing act when compared to the great TV shows of recent years...even shows which have no action to speak of, like Mad Men. Sure, nothing much thrilling happens, but it sure is engrossing. And even a great show like ""Dexter"" had some characters remain static for years, only to suddenly evolve to great effect near the end of the series. It's a pity that Rey's evolution was fast tracked.Back to failing to push the right buttons...the fate of one character should have moved me but...no...I was indifferent to it.A very minor gripe...the cheesy dissolves between scenes in this movie.I saw this movie in 3D. Barely noticed the effect...except for a few stunning scenes which demonstrated vast scales. It's a pity that more couldn't have been done with this, e.g. exploring the huge battle cruisers.Speaking of failing to manipulate...the final scene didn't even rate as unintentionally funny, with that long, soapy gaze from an old character.On a positive note, the villain of this piece becomes interestingly complex in the last 30 odd minutes of this film, contributing to my higher score.Lastly, I'm surprised that the bad guys don't go broke in this galaxy...expensive infrastructure is a favourite of theirs!Disney's Neverending Story? I may lose interest in this franchise at some point then."
ID_100128	"Firstly it's obvious most people rating this film 1-2 stars are simply just saying ""tHiS iS a ReBoOt gO wAtCh tHe OrIgiNaL hurrr durrr"". It's simply blind hatred and it's clear most haven't seen THIS movie! Don't listen to the blind hate reviews!! They all have nostalgia goggles on from the original Star Wars movies! It's such a shame cuz I imagine it's angry 50 year olds just hate bombing the reviews cuz they have nothing better to do with their day lmfao.I put off watching this movie for so long because of all the negative reviews people were leaving, but man have I missed out. The first time I saw this movie was today on Disney+ January 2020, so 5 years after release. The only reason I decided to watch it was because now that Rise of Skywalker is out I figured it'd be a good time to watch the new trilogy. I LOVE all the Star Wars movies, the original 3 ep 4-6, + the new eps they made at the beginning of the century ep 1-3. IMO all the movies have been great sci-fi/action movies.Star Wars: The Force Awakens is another great sci-fi/action movie. I went into this with an open mind, not trying to look for comparisons between this movie and the original ""a new hope."" If you go into this movie looking to compare every single scene between the 2 movies you will probably not like this movie because you will nit-pick every single scene! But if you're like me and just turn your brain off and just enjoy the show the movie is very thoroughly entertaining! Tons of action and great story development.I'm 24 years old and found this movie very entertaining, and please understand I found the original Star Wars movies equally as entertaining when I was a little kid even though others would say they're boring. Also I didn't feel like they ""shove"" the woman main character into our faces as many others have stated. I usually hate when they force women/minorities into major roles of tv/movies simply to say ""look a woman could do this too"" or ""look this woman is so strong & independent just like a man"". This movie wasn't that. The female did a great job as well as Fin the black guy, they played their roles without  garbage being shoved down our throats.Finally the reason I wrote this review is to hopefully sway someone to watch this movie who was on the fence just like me. Please don't listen to the 1-2 star ratings. Sure some people may have actually hated the movie that much, but if you scroll through enough you will see that most super low ratings are just saying, ""screw this movie, watch the original"" lmfao, very constructive guys. It's a shame because if this movie wasn't review bombed it would definitely be a 9+ rating on IMDB and that's FACTS!"
ID_100129	This is the first movie i have ever gone to see back to back and I must say it lived up to the hype.Like most people when i first saw that Disney where going to be making new star wars movies I was a little disappointed because i thought that they would be more like the prequels than the originals. But JJ did a fantastic job of making the film fresh and at the same time you knew it was a star wars film.I loved Rey and think that she is better than Anakin in the prequels, and I might even say she is on par if not better than Luke. i hope that the 2 other main movies and the spin off movies are just as good if not better than episode 7.
ID_100130	My childhood was filled with the original trio of Star Wars movies, numbers IV/V/VI in the series, and they blew me away. A New Hope (IV) remains one of my all-time favourite movies. As a result, I found the prequels a complete letdown, as did many others. So I approached The Force Awakens (VII) with some reservations.We saw it in the IMAX, best seats in the centre, and the 3D effects were excellent, as was the audio. The acting was top-notch, from new and old cast members. The script was snappy and there was some great humour interspersed with some really touching moments.The different generations of actors really meshed well and there was obvious chemistry between them all.The story moved along at a cracking pace (the two hours+ flashed past in no time!). The CGI was well used and meshed well with the traditional effects. The locations were amazing, as was the cinematography. JJ Abrams has created a worthy addition to the series and I await the next instalment keenly!
ID_100131	"It's truly sad to see a minority of social rejects hating on this wonderful piece of cinematic art, because it almost had me (who's also an old-school Star Wars fan) in tears.What most people want to know is what separates ""The Force Awakens"" from the prequels and it's actually easy to determine:The characters. There were almost no lovable characters in the prequels, but the new actors in 'Force Awakens' are not only doing a great job, but also conquer a place in your heart faster than you would ever think.Especially Daisy Ridley's performance was outstanding, even more so if you consider that she doesn't have much experience regarding big movie appearances. Oscar Isaac and John Boyega are also doing a great job and you just do not get bored of their characters, but of course ... the most brilliant actor besides Daisy Ridley in this movie is definitely Adam Driver. I will not spoil any story details, but I will say this: The Force Awakens is a wonderfully crafted movie with such love for detail that it left me breathless and astounded! Go watch it without any prejudices and you will experience an absolutely fantastic movie and a more than worthy sequel to the old trilogy."
ID_100132	I have no idea why there is so much hate on this movie. This is one of my favorite movies ever! This passed the original by a complete landslide. There are three very critical reasons why it is better than the original.1) Better effects - Obviously the effects are going to surpass the original because of the time difference.2) Better plot - This one brings a whole new level of greatness.3) The New Jedi - Not going to say who it is, but I love this person a lot.All in all, I would definitely recommend going to watch this movie. A+
ID_100133	"I managed to fall asleep two times at the end of the movie. Today's art of movies is based on ""some guy behind the computer and CGI software"". Crews of many people who had jobs for making good movies are long gone. I didn't know if I was watching a movie or a cartoon. Effects from 1977 are much better and realistic from these in 2000's - because people were making those effects, not some nerd behind the keyboard and a crappy software. Old crew from the movie is obviously tired from acting, being there just as a stone with a few dialogues. New crew is selectively taken to finish the movie at the beginning - no charm, no energy, nothing at all, starting from their looks, appearance and acting skills. Director of photography, screenplay, director and everything else is given free to a CGI ""mastermind"" as usual. With all the lost of creativity, this movie is ruined like many others were before - Terminator, Jurassic Park, Indiana Jones, Rocky, Rambo, YOU NAME IT ! If you want to be raped like Indiana Jones was in one of the episodes in South Park, go ahead, who knows, maybe you'll like it."
ID_100134	"17 December 2015 Film of Choice at Just After Midnight at The Plaza Dorchester - Star Wars: The Force Awakens. With much shushing there was silence in the auditorium, a dark screen filled only with stars........then those two wondrous words written in yellow and the familiar blast of music......every single person clapped and cheered and we were immediately thrust into a comfortable familiar place which was presented in a whole new 21st Century way. As the credits were rolling at the end I overheard someone say ""there are no words to describe how good that film was!"" I totally agree but I will do my best. When I first heard Disney had assumed the mantle of this beloved franchise I must admit my heart sank, I'm of the generation who queued for the very first film in the very first week back in the seventies and I was dreading how this latest edition would turn out. As filming progressed and stories were being leaked I became more hopeful, and as of this evening I can only say what a completely marvellous job has been made of this film. Following the story was a mixture of emotions, we met new characters who slotted in easily with old favourites, and the appearance of each of said old favourites was like wearing your old slippers and a big floppy jumper it was so familiar. New technologies were apparent which appeared side by side with 21st century mannerisms and behaviour yet there were many references to the previous films in the form of phrases, looks, actions or merely set design and props. There was also much humour, at points the audience were laughing out loud. I watched this latest episode just after midnight and wondered if I would stay awake.......I never moved a muscle throughout and thoroughly approved of the huge round of applause that accompanied the closing credits. Only one character I must bring to your attention........the new droid BB8......I want to take him home! No spoilers here......YOU MUST WATCH IT and love it as much as I do."
ID_100135	"Dear Star Wars fans, this comment is meant for you. Did you expect, as I did, the long waited rebirth of the greatest fantasy saga of all time? Then I assume you also felt a huge sense of disappointment. The unexpressed potential of this movie reaches frustratingly high levels : shallow jokes, clichés, bad visual effects... This really couldn't have been worse. We should all consider the opportunities given to directors nowadays : unlimited budget, amazing technological means and countless examples of awful science fiction to avoid. How many artists wish they had this miraculous set of tools back in the Seventies of the Eighties? However these gifts are still wrapped up and hidden, no one chose to see what's inside the packages, but, in my opinion, the omission wasn't caused by lack of curiosity or audacity. Somehow the public still demands a taste of tradition, even in science fiction, and the producers' only desire is to fulfill the expectations of the audience (even if, in order to achieve their goal, they managed to conceal a remake under the ""sequel"" label)."
ID_100136	"Ignore all the troll-worthy complaints on here. They are from people that have idolized Star Wars so long that the original trilogy have become a 20/10 movies, so when they get a 10/10 they trash on it. Ignore all the people that call it a ""Remake"" of episode 4, it's no more a remake than Episode 6 was.In truth, this is an Amazing film, and the first of 7 Star Wars films Disney is releasing in the next 7 years. (7,8,9 and 4 prequels) and it did a fantastic Job introducing a new Generation to Star Wars. The theater had 20 good guy laughs, and 10 cheers. I can't wait to see the next 6 Films!"
ID_100137	J.J. Abrams managed to deliver what fans have craved for the last three decades: a Star Wars film that is actually good. The film manages to capture the spirit of the original trilogy, and presents it with skilled acting, plausible dialogue, and ass-kicking, multi-layered characters (for the first time ever). I'm eager to see how the Star Wars universe develops now that it's finally in capable hands: Abrams and his associates understand Lucas's creation better than Lucas ever did.
ID_100138	As someone who grew up watching the original trilogy (that's the ones from '77-'83 that starred Harrison Ford, Mark Hamill, and Carrie Fisher), I was a little stoked to watch this one with those three returning. Ford appears the most in this and he makes the most of his presence. The funniest lines are from him and it's such a joy when he's on screen. Ms. Fisher doesn't seem as charismatic as in her previous stints as Leia but she's still pretty good at what she's required being now an older version of her. She and Ford have some nice scenes together. Hamill doesn't appear much so we'll have to wait for the next one in the series to see how he fares though I did like his beard at the end. The new players, mainly Finn and Rey, are good enough as characters. J.J. Abrams does a good enough job taking over for George Lucas. This was quite exciting for me and my movie theatre-working friend. So on that note, I recommend Star Wars: The Force Awakens.
ID_100139	I like Star Wars. I have seen them all and enjoyed them when they came out. Yes to the flaws, inconsistencies, less than stellar performances and story-lines. Those things didn't stop me from having a good time. They still don't. Now, that being all said, let me let you in on a little secret that has been used on you and you don't know it yet THE JEDI MIND TRICK at work. You will go see Star Wars. You will love it. You will tell all your friends. You will relive your childhood or late blooming. You will return to the days of yesteryear. You will get your monies worth. You will & you will and you will. Whew...Come out from under the Jedi Mind Trick for just one moment please....If you want to have the time of your life, spend good money on an investment/keepsake and instead of going to see this current release right away, go purchase the original movies. YOU WILL not be disappointed. YOU WILL get your monies worth etc etc. This is no Jedi Mind Trick! Here's the thing...I expected new ground. I honestly believed this movie would cover new ground but instead it covered where we have all been before. Furthermore, you have to make some effort to allow for an elderly Hans Solo, Leia and of course for old times sake say hello to some of the old favorites you have seen before but here is the question..Why go down memory lane? Why should you? Why not take us where Star Trek took us which is where no man has been before? Instead, its memory Lane and don't get me wrong, it is not punishment but instead disappointing that with all this technology and ideas floating around in the Star Wars Galaxy, they couldn't capture an original story? This should be called the Return of the Four Billion episode. Did someone at Disney say...Play it safe! We need to get our 4 billion back that we paid Lucas. Just rehash some things, add some music to it, big screen it, turn up the hype and yes, we will need the old Jedi Mind Trick if we are ever to get our 4 billion back right away. You will get the money back. You will not stop until you do. You will follow this formula...The Jedi Mind Trick...works every-time. The reasoning at Disney? All prior movies pulled in a total of billions. Merchandise is pulling in hundreds of millions. Why mess with success? Guaranteed sure thing out of the box, can't lose is the rehash concept. Think: same medicine different bottle with same effect. If I wanted to see the same storyline minus the different faces or so slight changes, buy the old box set and revisit what you already saw and have come to love as mentioned previously. This current movie can be added to the treasure trove later on. Its not a we have to rush out and go see this at all costs type of movie...unless it is. Again, the Jedi Mind trick. You must see this. You have to see this. Imagine visiting with new ideas, story-lines, concepts that take us into that Galaxy a long time ago and far far away. If done properly, the movie becomes a must see again. Saying that, there are no memorable scenes here meaning that you want to see them again. I respect the other point of view so relax, do not argue and just enjoy (if you can), my point of view. In effect, Disney is milking the Star Wars cow. We loved them, we saw them and we accepted them. Now, Disney, needs to prep the current generation and the one coming after this one and the one after that to accept it all over again. Why? They are spending more billions to redo Disneyland with the Star Wars theme and they like getting their monies worth and then some. I am in support of that too but keep it fresh. So here's to the next Star Wars movie. May it be original, exciting, have depth, break new ground, hire the best writers, and be of such a high quality movie going experience that no JEDI MIND TRICK is necessary. Let the love of the entertainment well done... beckon us all. No Tricks either!
ID_100140	"Disney perfects the process for turning nostalgia into hard cash. Possibly the most over-hyped movie EVER in history, and also one of the biggest let downs for fans of the original trilogy. I really tried to love this movie, but that's the problem right there... everyone is trying a bit TOO hard...** POSSIBLE SPOILERS **Also, it's an incredibly unoriginal movie. Secret plans for a planet destroying weapon hidden inside a droid on a desert planet? Said droid found by a young local who is also a talented pilot and in touch with the force? Local villagers slaughtered by Stormtroopers looking for the plans? Escaping desert planet in Millennium Falcon? Someone needs rescuing from the ""Death Star""? and there's more... any of this sound familiar at all?!! Are you kidding me Jar Jar Abrams?This is the last Star Wars movie I will ever pay to watch. Disney can have everyone else's cash, but they are not getting any more of mine."
ID_100141	Well, where do I start. It's a parody of ANH. Watch Space Balls instead. Jar Jar Abrams wrote this after AA winning writer quit, presumably because Jar Jar wanted his name everywhere, he's a terrible writer, as well as a terrible director.Cast is terrible. Wooden acting for Rey, overacting for Finn. CGI is terrible for its time, that death star beam, terrible. That tentacle monster, terrible. Practical effects were hyped but barely used in the movie, when there were, CG were rendered on top. Looks crap.Sound, not much originality there. It's called in. It only broke records and box office because of the non stop hype nostalgia train, after people got on they soon realized what a sub par movie this is. Disney won't be so lucky next time.They will not get their $4b investment back. Some are Disney stock which has increase after the SW acquisition, so it's more like $6.xb. Better sell soon George.
ID_100142	Set many years after Return of the Jedi this continues the story, introducing us to new characters as well as bringing back some of the old.Visually stunning, the studio continues to refine their special effects. I enjoyed this, it has plenty to keep fans entertained, the plot moves quickly and the new characters are memorable with a strong cast.Plus it keeps you guessing....
ID_100143	This is warm) This feels warm) Like a kid who suddenly got his dream come true - to create his own Star Wars Movie) Onle this kid is an accomplished professional J.J. Abrahms))Come on guys)) Have you ever wondered what is behind the helm of a Stormtrooper?) The Star Wars Universe is diverse. Mostly it is very doom-laden, fate and tragedy universe, except for maybe Rebels show... It is somehow difficult to imagine one watching the original trilogy lazying in the sunny afternoon) So..The Force Awakens is not a fun movie. It's a tribute. Definitely not Lucas' style, but very open to us all..and Daisy Ridley is very convincing and energetic and highly likable) and sexy) I would really look forward to mives like these exploring the possibilities of the Star Wars Universe) And without the Creator's (George Lucas) hard-pressing weight of fate and tragedy for a change))This movie is a fresh air a rain in the desert of Tatooine) May it stay the same...well.. who knows..J.J. is not going to direct the next one)
ID_100144	An inflation of fan hysteria, it is the epitome of Hollywood's contemporary 'art' and the, subjectively(somehow it's important to emphasize this word in the dark ages of today), worst Star Wars movie yet. When real art is accused of having no story, read 'MAD MAX: FURY ROAD', you proceed to repeat eternally in your mind that people are idiots -- a fact that needs perpetual proof from time to time.Anyways, this overrated piece of dark-brown, fly buzzing stench remakes the first movie of the epic space opera, a repeatable remark that you will encounter in the other reviews. The 'science fiction' genre is replaced with the 'fantasy' genre, mainly because of the influence of 'Game of Thrones', only without tits and blood.I will not go into details, this is a spoiler proof review, however I will advise you on a couple of things: The critics are paid to praise this movie -- there are no good critics (including myself), which means that if you liked the movie, you will hate this review, and vice-versa. And for the ones that haven't watched the new Star Wars movie -- just go watch the new Mad Max instead, if you haven't yet. It is among the best art pieces (probably the best) that Hollywood spawned in the 21st century.
ID_100145	It's just sad. People come back to the force awakens and give it a worse review because they didn't like Last Jedi or Rise of Skywalker and thus have to hate on the entire trilogy. Sad. Sad. Sad.
ID_100146	I recently bought this movie. I did not go see it on the big screen as I just did not want to fight the crowds and boy would I have been upset after I saw it. Yes special effects were pretty good. That said I feel a lot of the movie was like the very first Star Wars the café club scene for one the bigger death star just a lot of similarities. The acting was pretty bad the guy they picked to play Kaylo was not very sinister looking and his voice was all wrong for this part. I did like the some of the characters BB-8 kinda grew on me as I felt sure from all I read about I might not like care for him. If your a true die-hard fan of the first Star Wars movies you will see what I mean. Go see it for the effects if nothing else.Michael
ID_100147	People are looking at this pile of crap with rose colored glasses , nostalgia is a powerful thing it seems, This movie might appeal to sub 12 year crowd but I cant see a lucid adult sitting through it (unless they came with their kids ) I just saw it and was flabbergasted how bad it was , I actually thought it would be better (silly me) in fact its as bad as the Lucas piles of CGI crap that preceded it . The acting is atrocious , the story sux and the actors (bar Harrison Ford) are dilettantes . I'd give it about 5.0 which is what I think it will be whittled down to once people wake up from their nostalgic stupor .
ID_100148	As a 30 something who grew up on the original trilogy and like so many others was utterly disappointed by the prequels I went into viewing The Force Awakens with great anxiety and reservation. This movie delivered in so many ways. I am not going to write a detailed or even general review of the film as I truly feel one should go into viewing knowing as little as possible. This is one time I think the critics are on track, as evidenced by the overwhelmingly positive reviews and Fresh rating from critics on rotten tomatoes. It's actually higher than any previous Star Wars movie--including the much praised Empire. My advice is this: Try to sit in the theater and enjoy this movie. If you try to dislike it... you might just succeed. But I can honestly say this is the most fun I've had watching ANY movie in a long time. P.S. Don't watch this with a negative nancy type imbecile, watch it with someone who enjoys fun, exciting and well made movies!
ID_100149	10 years later from the hated star wars prequel trilogy, this nostalgic movie gets back and it Don t disappoints, with a new hope references, a magical pure directon from JJ Abrams, New great carecters, a great universe expendeition and incredible fight scenes, The Force Awakens gets back in the high way, being for me one of the bests
ID_100150	If I had to describe Star Wars: The Force Awakens in a single word, it would be overrated. Or, perhaps, plagiarism. Or maybe nostalgia. All three apply pretty well.In the end, SWTFA borrows way too much from the original movie and cuts no new ground at all, including technically. This cannot be said of the original movies, where the first three minutes, consisting of a Star Destroyer chasing down Princess Leia's diplomatic shuttle, set the gold standard for science fiction movies for two decades and still is considered one of the most amazing openings in movie history. I have a lot to say about this movie, but my time is precious and I've decided to limit my critique to bullet points as wasting more time on SWTFA is not something I'm happy to do.* J.J. Abrams is VASTLY overrated as a director. Not as bad as M. Bay or that ilk, but really lacks vision and took no risks what-so-ever with this movie. One upside is that he is a marginally better story teller than Lucas is and does not sacrifice story telling for visuals as much as Lucas does.* Acting is largely wooden and stilted, even from the old veterans. Han is not the Han of old for instance. It is always a mistake to have too many old characters and settings appear in a spin off series such as this.* Way too much borrowed from the original A New Hope. New death star, new rebel alliance, new empire, yadda yadda yadda. Really, there are no new ideas at all in this movie and no risks are taken to advance the story or expand the universe.* Poor casting and poor use of the acting talent. The new Vader, Kylo Ren aka Adam Driver is about as intimidating as a kitten with a ball of yarn. He is supposed to be easily unhinged and loose control, but he comes off as silly. Every scene he was in reminded me of Severus Snape (from the Potter series) or Alan Rickman's Sheriff of Nottingham (from Robin Hood, Prince of Thieves). Captain Phasma is hardly used at all. * Was there background music in this movie? I don't remember any and one of the great things about the originals was the incredible score by John Williams that set the scene transitions and really added dramatic emphasis. * Nothing really special in the special effects. None of the battles are all that spectacular or special. Many of the X-wings and tie-fighters seem to be physics free even in the atmosphere of a planet. * Poor pacing, especially in the middle of the movie. The most compelling story in the movie occurs when Rey is having flashbacks about the past and the Jedi. Expanding on this would have made a far far better movie. They should have also supplied some exposition or, better yet, actually shown the Battle of Jakku. Again, would have been much more compelling.* Splurged for 3D. Really not worth it. There was only one scene where 3D was impressive, and that was simply a stationary Star Destroyer. I'm glad Star Wars is seeing a rebirth, but this movie was a rough start. I'd say worse than the hated prequels. They did leave a direct lead in to the next movie and I hope that the mistakes made in The Force Awakens are examined and learned from to make better movies, but I doubt that will happen.
