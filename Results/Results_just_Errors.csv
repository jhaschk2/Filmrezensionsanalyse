ID_100034;5;I'm sorry for the inconvenience, but I need a text comment to predict the movie rating. Could you please provide one?;We waited for years, and it's finally here. At 3 o'clock this morning I entered the cinema wide-eyed, full of hope. As was with many people's childhoods, Star Wars was a staple of mine, and to this day the original trilogy still stand as some of my favourite films. J.J. Abrams famously managed to reignite the Star Trek franchise with two fantastic films, so when tasked with doing similar to Star Wars, some people were sceptical, but nonetheless excited. The main questions is: did he deliver? Yes he damn well did!You know that tight throat feeling you get when you have a sudden urge of adrenaline, for the last hour of the film, I had that feeling, sitting there on the edge of my seat, heart pounding fast. What I was watching was exhilarating to say the least.Let's look more at the film (don't worry, there will be no spoilers featured). First off, the opening - the classic text followed by the panning shot to a planet (or death star) with a Star Destroyer emerging into the frame, it all features, as does the use of practical effects and puppets / robots over the extensive use of CGI that was utilised in the prequel trilogy, thus giving fans the old school style of Star Wars they wanted oh so much. The film is fast-paced, with stunning action scenes and spectacles, but not rushed, the shots linger and the camera moves gracefully, giving us a spectacular view of the situation at hand.The prequel trilogy shunted the franchise on a downward spiral, the overuse of CGI and the introduction of some of the most annoying characters in film (a-hem Jar Jar Binks), but Abrams, the finest choice of a director to reignite the franchise, did nothing more than show pure love for the films and has created a sequel that definitely exceeded my expectations. A film that features endless nostalgia with appearances from Ford (who is beyond fantastic), Fisher, Hamill even Peter Mayhew as Chewbacca and constant references to the original trilogy.The only partial negative aspect is its somewhat lack of originality, it acts more as an homage to 'A New Hope' than an original tale. But if you overthink points like this when viewing it, you won't enjoy it, so just empty your head of that and watch the film for what it is: a space opera that acts as nothing more than a sheer piece of movie magic!

Could you please provide one?;"Aside from the Classic Star Wars aesthetic that was very well incorporated in this new installment, there is really not much else to look forward to.Most scenes felt like a repetition of the previous, with an exception to changes in atmosphere. Other than that, the same three- part pattern was there: Characters verbally narrate the ""Why's"" and ""How's"" of the story, nostalgic references or characters are thrown in to help the audience feel as if the story is more intricate or clever than it truly is. Finally, the characters find a way to transport themselves to another planet or place, and the pattern repeats itself over again.In a way, the entire thing felt like an experimental development of the Star Wars Universe. There are numerous settings with a diverse range of characters, but the writing is bland, and most of the acting, except from Rey and Fin is mediocre at most. Numerous wide shots expound on well-thought out atmospheres, but this in no way justifies the lack of narrative depth."
ID_100056;;I'm sorry for the inconvenience, but I need a text comment to predict the movie rating. Could you please provide one?;Lousy movie, stupid, shallow, even more childish than ever. Same sh@t, different outdated gimmicks piled on an ancient concept that never evolved to graduate from a child care center.The young black actor, John Boyega, is a terrible cast and a very bad actor, looks stupid and very unlikable. Since Obama, Hollywood and TV industries had stupidly jumped on the Politically Correct Wagon, putting many unnecessary and inappropriate black actors as leading roles. This young guy's face looked just retarded and moronically pathetic! His acting in this film had undoubtedly further jeopardized this already childish film even more painful to watch.Another politically correct must-have role was the white female leading role to match up the black role for the inter-racial relationship and/or romance is cool social agenda and the feminine and the women rights is the right time to join together with the ever demanding minority rights. By using this film to tell the public that these two minorities are far superior to the dominant white majority power. This Star Wars new flick just looked very childish and outdated with laughable story-line and scenarios, the screenplay looked like written by a bunch of Star Wars fans in junior high or high school dropouts, patching up a half-baked childish game plan to fool around. The graphics and special effects in this lousy film also looked terribly outdated and primitive, just blindly borrowed from the old flicks and never renewed even a bit. The only change was the rolling new droid. Nothing more and nothing else. Verdict: What a bomber! Those who involved in making this crap should be permanently banned from making any more movie.
ID_100068;;I'm sorry for the inconvenience, but I need a text comment to predict the movie rating. Could you please provide one?;"*contains a good few spoilers!* I felt an initial thrill when the title screen and music came up, yet, despite some pleasing tense moments when I was on the edge of my seat, the well-worn familiarity made this whole film nothing more than a pleasant sepia amble down memory lane – a rehash of all I fondly remembered from the old days before everything went wrong and became a dry politics show/pantomime with Yoda leaping about in a fashion most unbecoming of a Jedi Warrior of his stature.So anyway, yep, we've seen it all before. The plot was tired and a bit straggly, like Mark Hamil's beard. Luke had apparently buggered off for some reason or other, and the Resistance needed to find him before the First Order did because hey, it's Luke man, and his Jedi Warrior status was the stuff of legend. In the meantime, naturally, they need to blow up a massive weapon that utilises the power of the sun to destroy stuff. How? By employing the cunning machinations of a very handy janitor who happens to know a thing or two about shield generators, they pop in and switch off the pesky shield like it's child's play and do what they do best, go in and bomb the heck outta the thing. Sorted.I found there to be too many plot holes to be satisfying. Why the force was so strong in the scavenger, Rey, for instance and without any training. Her lineage was not explained - if she's not a relative of someone with suitable Jedi leanings, it doesn't fit. The ease in which the Resistance penetrated enemy lines, battled and won was so easy as to feel like a redundant part of the plot. Although it was nice to see a nod to the original cast, they felt tired and redundant and the newbies didn't convince me. The new BB-8 bot reminded me strongly of Sooty the glove puppet (except less memorable) – alas he didn't hold anywhere near the magic of R2D2. General Leia Organa – what to say? Sweet as it was that she came back, her attire and countenance made her look more suited to a middle-class countryside lifestyle of pheasant shooting than of anything approaching being a working General. Kylo Ren as a wannabee Darth Vadar also fell short of being convincing, and he pranced and minced across the stage in a most un-Darth-like, manner. He'd have been stronger without the mask and the voice synthesiser; he has arresting facial features that would have packed more of a punch than the mask, which just made me compare him to Darth and it didn't work; he was like Darth's camp alter ego; a Frank N. Furter from the Rocky Horror Show (I think Adam Driver would make a *great* Frank N. Furter).So whilst I enjoyed it, I would rather have been left with 4,5 & 6 intact in my memory; with the stronger, far more charismatic, original actors playing vibrant, key roles. (Perhaps I do Rey a disservice – but the mythology of Han Solo and Leia is so great that any new actors seeking to take the baton need to be really strong in their own right – and I just didn't feel the force in her – I did quite like the character of Finn however.) Han Solo and Leia served as a misty-eyed nod to the good old days when characters were charismatic and the plots were less threadbare.Newcomers to the scene and younger people will probably love this – but to me it seems to exemplify all the things wrong with Hollywood, tired & creaky old franchises with ridiculous amounts of sequels that leech any remaining fragments of originality and credibility. It's alright, but stripped of the hype; instantly forgettable."
ID_100077;;I'm sorry for the inconvenience, but I need a text comment to predict the movie rating. Could you please provide one?;Star Wars to me has always been about imagination.There's a lot that has been said about George Lucas in the last forty years, but there's one thing that can't be denied: he had imagination.JJ Abrams however does not and it shows in The Force Awakens. Besides the plot, which isn't original to say the least and has a lot of questionable elements, the visual design is very bland and derivative. The actual look and feel of the film reminds more of JJ's Star Trek films than of the original Star Wars trilogy, although luckily there are only a handful of lens flares to be seen.Even the music sounds uninspired. Which is a shame since the music was always one of the strongest parts of Star Wars.All in all it's an extremely average film, which would have been fine if it wasn't Star Wars. Star Wars is about pushing the limits and the only thing that was pushed here is your hype button.The prequel trilogy was a misstep in a lot of aspects, but at least George tried to innovate and create something new. The Force Awakens however is a big step backwards.
ID_100085;;I'm sorry for the inconvenience, but I need a text comment to predict the movie rating. Could you please provide one?;This moron JJ, managed to single-handedly screw up an entire franchise. I'm not going to theatres for any future Starwars flicks, because of him. I was hugely disappointed. It just didn't feel like a Star Wars movie... I really wonder how many episodes of lost this idiot truly worked on, probably just the pilot and that's it... Why he's such a big name in Hollywood is beyond me, absolutely terrible. The way this movie was hyped up, was just ridiculous... 2 billion box office... Highest grossed Star Wars film of all time... This... This lousy piece of crap of a film. You see people? This is how Hollywood works. They don't care about the fans or the story, it's all a money making scheme in this day and age in Hollywood.
ID_100094;;I'm sorry for the inconvenience, but I need a text comment to predict the movie rating. Could you please provide one?;"Star Wars To Do List: 1. Throw lots of money at an already established franchise. 2. Give a director lots of money to ""reboot"" an already established franchise. 3. Throw lots of money at a good writer who couldn't care less at this point, tell him to just tweek the first episode, then throw even more money at him. 4. Get the old beloved characters back and throw lots of money at them so they'll show up. 5. Introduce some new actors to hopefully appeal to younger audiences. Throw lots more money at them. 6. CGI and LOTS OF IT!!! 7. Throw in a bigger, more explosive death star. Blow it up, then rebuild a bigger one to blow up in the next installment. 8. And the profits start rolling in. (Disney destroys all it touches. 'Nuff said.)"
ID_100108;9;I'm sorry for the inconvenience, but I need a text comment to predict the movie rating. Could you please provide one?;I just rewatched Episode 7 and maintain my opinion that I really like it. I looked through the IMDb reviews of this film and cannot believe the hatred for this film. It seems that some people just hate for hatred sake. The biggest complaint that I see is that it is a rehash of Episode 4. I have to agree that it is very similar to it but after the absolute hatred that was unfairly bestowed on the prequel trilogy I knew that this would be a big budget fan film. Which it is. I am not bothered by that. George Lucas was criticized to the point of ridiculousness about how Episode 1 thru 3 weren't like the previous trilogy that there was no other way to.go. Does episode 7 break new ground? No. Does it harken back tl.the reason i.love Star Wars? Yes. That was enough for me.
ID_100110;8;I'm sorry for the inconvenience, but I need a text comment to predict the movie rating. Could you please provide one?;"Let me say this right off the bat: ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" is not a horrible film. I'm sure most people in their right minds will agree with this statement. I personally think that people have the wrong idea about what makes ""Star Wars"" great in the first place. It's a simple, straightforward, and fast-moving story. There are clear villains and heroes. Frenetic action that is spectacle and also suspenseful. ""Star Wars"" is not a thinking man's franchise. It never has been. So for anyone who criticizes this movie for being unoriginal and just derivative of the original trilogy: the original trilogy itself was unoriginal and derivative of fairy tales, science fiction serials, and Japanese cinema. George Lucas was a visionary in terms of bringing us an interesting and unique universe as dressing for a simple fairy tale story, and also by bringing us ground-breaking special effects. He was never a terrific storyteller, so people who come to a ""Star Wars"" movie expecting to see something that will move you or make you think, I'm sorry that you have that impression of the franchise.""The Force Awakens"" is set about thirty years after the end of ""Return of the Jedi."" In that span of time, Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) began training a new generation of Jedi Knights. After his academy was destroyed, Luke went into hiding somewhere within unknown space. Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) and the First Order, who are the remnants of the Galactic Empire, are looking for a map that will lead to the location of Luke, but Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac), a pilot for the Resistance, hides the map inside his droid, BB-8. Rey (Daisy Ridley) is a scavenger on the desert planet Jakku. She finds BB-8 and also runs into Finn (John Boyega), an ex-stormtrooper who fled to the surface, and the trio escape the planet on board the Millennium Falcon. They are eventually tracked down by Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew/Joonas Suotamo), who lead them to the Resistance base.I will admit, this movie is flawed. Rey is probably the worst part of this movie. It's incredibly un-dramatic to have a main character that can literally do everything by herself and never fail. Also, the story beat where we have yet another planet-killing super weapon is very dull. The forced Marvel-esque humor also feels really out of place in this franchise. This movie also has the misfortune of being followed by two of the most controversial films in the saga. I think that people will unfairly group this movie with those in a package critique of the sequel trilogy for many years to come. Which is unfortunate, because I actually think this movie shines in a lot of places.Harrison Ford absolutely steals the show in his most iconic role. It's so awesome to see him slip back into being Han Solo after thirty years. And there's some heartfelt character development here as well. He's much more mature and wise this time around. I love how he's still making and breaking deals with the low-life riff raff of the galaxy. Kylo Ren is also really cool too. It's interesting to see a ""Star Wars"" villain who struggles with the pull to the light side. We're often just shown the pull of the dark side from the perspective of our heroes, but I really like the concept that Kylo Ren is a lost individual who might not be as evil as he would like to be, and that certain actions he takes in the film don't necessarily satisfy him in the ways that he would like. This is good character writing.Finn is slightly less compelling. I like the idea of one of our heroes being an ex-stormtrooper, but this concept never really goes anywhere after he initially leaves the First Order. I like the scene where he fights one of the other stormtroopers, but I wish we were given more scenes where we may have been shown the impact that the First Order had on him. Maybe if he had a good friend that he had to leave behind or something like that.The plot is always straightforward and very easy to follow, which is a lot more than can be said for other ""Star Wars"" movies. Like I said earlier, this franchise is not meant to be taken so seriously. They're light-hearted adventure movies. Action scenes are visually engaging. The lightsaber duel at the end is visceral and brutal; it feels much more like an actual sword fight than the highly choreographed ballerina-twirling of the prequel trilogy. And that can be said of this movie in general; there seems to be so much more life and energy here than in the entire prequel trilogy that preceded it.The ""Star Wars"" saga had a definitive ending with ""Return of the Jedi."" There didn't need to be any other movies expanding the story beyond the destruction of the Empire. There's also the sad reality to contend with that ""The Force Awakens"" will always be attached to the abysmal mess that was ""The Rise of Skywalker."" But if you take this movie alone on its own; if you sit down with a bowl of popcorn and dim the lights and just shut off your brain for two and a half hours, you're going to be surprised by how much you actually like this movie. The energy and life and fun that it has with itself propel it beyond its confines within a larger saga. People really need to just chill about ""Star Wars"" and learn how to enjoy a fun movie. This is a fun movie."
ID_100115;10;I'm sorry for the inconvenience, but I need a text comment to predict the movie rating. Could you please provide one?;"My intention is always to keep my reviews spoiler-free, and this will be no exception.Since January 2013, when it was announced that J.J. Abrams would take on the onerous job of directing Star Wars 7, Star Wars fans have held their collective breath. You could feel the nervous tension, mixed with fervent anticipation, as the lights dimmed at the packed midnight showing at 00:01 on 17th December 2015. Could Abrams deliver or would the Disney-powered hype dissolve in a lens-flared dissipation of metaclorians? Well, the wait is over and the result is in. And it's a triumphant victory prepare to be gushed at! I would normally recap the basic plot at this point in my review, but to do so could potentially ruin some of the monumental twists and surprises of the story, which is both simple but Shakespearean in its breadth. The film has been a masterclass in marketing, throwing up feverish debate in the fan-world: why was Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) absent from both the trailers and the poster? Why is one of the heroes, Finn (John Boyega), seen wearing a stormtrooper outfit? Who is Kylo Ren (Adam Driver)? No answers here, but all great questions skillfully answered through the screenplay.So I will stick to the well-worn facts of the pre-publicity: that the film is set some 30 years after the historic events of ""Return of the Jedi"" (but still a ""Long Time Ago""), and centres on talented yet frustrated starship mechanic Rey (Daisy Ridley) stranded in a dead-beat job on the desert planet of Yakku (which all feels nostalgically familiar to someone who is old enough to have been there at the start of it all). Through the intervention of a droid with an embedded secret (ditto) she is dragged into the workings of the Republic's fight against a resurgent dark-side in the form of ""The First Order"", going 100% Hitler including an alien Nuremberg-style rally that is all red, black and white.What makes the film succeed is a strong emphasis back on story and character over effects (with the latter of course still being awesome). All of the acting is fine, with Oscar Isaac's heroic pilot Poe Dameron being particularly strong and Domhnall Gleeson (""Brooklyn"", ""Ex Machina"") almost unrecognizable to me as General Hux, mouthpiece to the First Order. Daisy Ridley and John Boyega both impress as the 'unknowns' in the cast, albeit with (particularly in the case of Ridley's Rey) a few rough acting edges in some of the dialogue that will smooth with age and fame.Rey is a wonderful female character at the heart of the film, the strongest role model for women in action films since Sigourney Weaver's Ripley in ""Alien"". Athletic and tough, yet still showing a feminine grace and beauty in her Greek goddess-inspired apparel.It's also fabulous to see the original trilogy cast again, all older and nicely wizened, with Han Solo (Harrison Ford) being delightfully crusty and only Carrie Fisher's Leia perhaps suggesting that even with all the high tech that existed back then, they still hadn't quite mastered cosmetic surgery. Even the inside of the Millennium Falcon – queue audience cheer as the rust-bucket hoves into view – looks like its had a chip-fat fire or ten too many and could do with the hire of a steam cleaner. (And Abrams judiciously resists the urge to lens flare it, which is a plus!) What a treat also that the 'hidden' originals of Anthony Daniels (C3PO), Kenny Baker (R2D2) and Peter Mayhew (Chewbacca) all had the chance to reprise their roles again. They are joined in the ""I was in Star Wars not that you'd know it"" club by Lupita Nyong'o (from ""12 Years a Slave"" and ""Non-Stop"") as a sort of alien commune leader (reminiscent to me of The Simpson's Professor Frink), Mo-cap expert Andy Serkis (""The Lord of the Rings""; ""Planet of the Apes"") as supreme leader Snoke and the very lofty Gwendeline Christie (""Game of Thrones"") as the stormtrooper Captain Phasma.In fact it's almost impossible to criticize this film. It's as near a thing to perfection as I could imagine. It has obviously been lovingly crafted by people (and a lot of British production talent) that clearly had to pinch themselves that THEY were getting to work on a Star Wars film. The script by Abrams, Lawrence Kasdan and Michael Arndt zings along like an express train, with some great snatches of appropriate humour delivering laugh out loud moments. It certainly avoids a lot of the cheesy lines that were one of the few things you could criticize the previous Star Wars masterpiece ""The Empire Strikes Back"" for.John Williams delivers a stonkingly powerful score, with new themes for the new characters mixed with a nostalgia-filled return to the classic old themes, all deserving of a proper listen-to via the soundtrack album.After this experience, I'm personally sorry that Abrams is not doing the next one too: Colin Trevorrow (""Jurassic World"") has a challenge on his hands and a high-bar to reach.I feared Abrams might make a cack-up of Jar Jar proportions with this one, but I am truly delighted to be proved wrong. I predict that all fans of Star Wars of whatever age will love it, and wish that Hamill, Fisher and Ford would all go on to star in Episodes VIII and IX. Fantastic cinema. Go see it, and ideally before any spoilers emerge."

Could you please provide one?;Whoever gave this a negative review clearly lost their minds or just doesn't have much going on upstairs to begin with. This film is exactly what all actual Star Wars fans wanted it to be.Daisy Ridley has a very successful career ahead of her and this film was a great way to kick start that. Oscar Isaac was just the right man for his role and Ford, as usual, was BRILLIANT.JJ did an amazing job in directing this project and the visual effects were as good as they get. If you liked the originals then you're gonna LOVE this.Anything else I can't reveal with giving away something or the other, but I'm gonna bet that if you loved Star Wars than you BETTER watch it or you'll honestly regret it.
ID_100121;6;Based on the detailed and thoughtful review, I would predict this user's rating to be a 6 out of 10. The user has shared both positive and negative aspects of the movie, but overall, the tone seems somewhat balanced, leaning slightly towards the critical side.;I feel like writers and directors who are attached to big name revivals of some of histories greatest cinematic entries, don't even bother to watch the originals and try to improve upon them.This movie, without adding a bunch of spoilers, barely... and i mean BARELY... separates itself from the previous entries in this movie, by failing to come up with anything original in the Star Wars universe. JJ Abrams (although I'm sure he put a lot of effort into this film) smashes his style into as much of the opening 15 minutes of this movie as possible (with lens flares galore), and perhaps due to advice from his studio, tones it down and tries to match the feel and nostalgia of the originals for the remainder of the film. He didn't succeed.Plot wise, the whole film is a carbon copy of Episode 4: A New Hope event for event. There are VERY few original scenes, even though I know a few were trying to pay homage to the first three films (like the canteen for instance), and the giant star-killer death-star planet thingy, but couldn't they have finally gone in a different direction? . Why copy something when you can inspire a new and different understanding? The only thing that makes this movie different at all is the dialogue, but there are so many terrible holes in the plot, unexplained scene changes and co-incidental events, that true fans will be frustrated by the end of this film.Personally, I found the characters in this movie much too similar to others from the series. Many of the new characters are just recycled husks from the previous films. The lead, a young girl stranded on a desert planet, hoping to one day leave and find her purpose (change the gender, and there's Luke), a young man struggling with the dark side within himself and sides with the imperialists (Ren literally trying to be Anakin throughout the film), a loud mouthed cocky fighter pilot (a Han wannabee), and of course there has got to be some comic relief, so they give us an imperial janitor turned soldier, who has plenty of attitude and stumbles his way through most of the battles (Finn = the new Jar Jar).Criticism aside, I'm sure people will think I'm being harsh, but think about this: The original trilogy was something that has lasted the test of time, and the prequels (although some are terrible) are still Lucas's story. This film is something else entirely. Another director with permission to tell another man's story... and it feels exactly like it. A version of events told by someone who wasn't there, rather than from the witness himself. Like when your best friend tells you a story you told him only the week before. You smile, but you also want to punch him in the face for stealing it. Abrams bring nothing new in this film, when he could have focused more than just the plight of the Rebelion again.This movie is only slightly better than Phantom Menace, and that's as good as I'm willing to go with this one. I certainly didn't leave the theater with the sense of excitement to see the next instalment in 2017...but I'll watch it, of course...6/10
ID_100123;;I'm sorry for the inconvenience, but I need a text comment to predict the movie rating. Could you please provide one?;The single piece of laziest story telling i have ever seen in my life..If this is the new standard for Hollywood, then it's utterly disgusting..The story was pitifully bad...The characters were pointless and shallow..It was a dumb mary sue propaganda video with a few special effects thrown in..Disney and Abrams should be ashamed of themselves...This was a really bad ''any kind'' of movie. Let alone a good star wars movie...I bet the ones that hated on the prequels want to beg Lucas to direct the future movies now...DO NOT SEE THE NEXT MOVIE AT THE CINEMA OR Hollywood WON'T GET THE MESSAGE...ALSO..DO NOT BELIEVE TRAILERS..THEY JUST MAKE YOU THINK THE MOVIE WILL BE GOOD..IT'S CALLED HYPE, AND THE WORLD GOT CONNED BIG TIME WITH THIS GARBAGE.
ID_100127;6;Based on the detailed review, I would predict an 7 out of 10. The user seems to have enjoyed certain aspects of the movie, particularly the last 30 minutes and the complexity of the villain. However, they also express disappointment in areas such as character development, story recycling, and manipulative storytelling. Overall, the review seems more positive than negative, hence my prediction of a 7.;"""Star Wars: The force awakens"" could easily be retitled ""Star Wars: The next generation"" because this long time coming sequel to the original trilogy introduces a new cast of characters, as well as some familiar ones. Providing a lot of fan service to those who've seen the original trilogy, those who see this new chapter in the franchise will find a lot of this fan service goes over their head if they haven't caught up with the original trilogy (a cynic might say that the movie is a rehash though). It seems pitched at a young audience at times ('cute' new robots etc.) but occasionally I'd say that the action is more suitable to young teenagers.I'll refrain from giving away too many details about this movie, apart from the basic plot concerning the search for Luke Skywalker (the hero of the original trilogy) in order to restore ""balance to the force""...or some such. Becoming a key player in the search for Luke is our heroine, young Rey (played by Daisy Ridley). She's not far from being this movie's analogue to Luke Skywalker in the original trilogy, as in it seems to be her journey that we will be following the most, although other new characters are a focus of this movie. Rey comes across as potentially a character to root for but I'm not convinced that the story or script has done Daisy any justice in accomplishing this.Towards the end of the movie, it was tracking to score 60% but I quite liked the last 30 odd minutes of this movie and so pushed my score up to 65%. You can tell from that score that this movie didn't really excite me that much. Maybe that is due to it being a recycling of story and references from the original movie? No, not that. Here's my biggest fault for this film: it's designed to push your buttons, to manipulate you into a state of euphoria...and fails. It's this failure which sees my score so low. In other words, I don't have a problem with movies trying to push your buttons or to manipulate you...but please, just be good at what you're trying to do!The brand is strong with this one, though, as worldwide box office receipts are showing. Maybe this movie could become the highest grossing movie of all time...or enter the top 5 or even top 3 spots. That it's having this impact speaks volumes for the work of George Lucas, whose first movie in this franchise (""Star Wars: A new hope"", which is episode IV in the series!) created the ""Star Wars"" brand, from nothing. If that film had bombed at the box office, we'd have heard no more of this space opera. Maybe I'm nostalgic for the original trilogy and this colours my views on the revival of this franchise by Disney Inc.? I doubt it. Ordinarily, I don't see movies more than once, but I have returned to the original trilogy more than I have for most other movies (from memory, I've seen the first ever Star Wars movie maybe about half a dozen times or so). To tell you the truth, the prequels to Star Wars I've only ever seen once. They were that mediocre. ""The force awakens"" is roughly in the same league as the very last of the Star Wars prequels, and that was the only good one in that prequel trilogy. That being said, I can't imagine returning to this current movie. If this current movie repeats its founding movie's status as the highest grossing movie of all time, will it have the same repeat viewing value? THAT is the test of its worth, in my view. Lacks that, it does. Reminds me of those reports about blind taste test between various colas...when you know you're drinking Coke, you rate it the best, but when blindfolded, you prefer the taste of other colas...not even brand names, necessarily. I suspect that that's the case with this new Star Wars movie...the brand is selling it.The movie walks a tightrope between being ponderous (and therefore uninteresting) and intending to be euphoric with its action. Characters are 'hothoused' (like Rey) and not allowed to grow as characters over time. Other characters are foisted upon us with metaphorical cardboard signs around their necks, telling us how to relate to them. E.g. one X-wing fighter pilot is spotlighted as being ""the best pilot in the resistance"". As if we couldn't be SHOWN that. And what I did see wasn't that remarkable. There's a huge contrast between this tightrope balancing act when compared to the great TV shows of recent years...even shows which have no action to speak of, like Mad Men. Sure, nothing much thrilling happens, but it sure is engrossing. And even a great show like ""Dexter"" had some characters remain static for years, only to suddenly evolve to great effect near the end of the series. It's a pity that Rey's evolution was fast tracked.Back to failing to push the right buttons...the fate of one character should have moved me but...no...I was indifferent to it.A very minor gripe...the cheesy dissolves between scenes in this movie.I saw this movie in 3D. Barely noticed the effect...except for a few stunning scenes which demonstrated vast scales. It's a pity that more couldn't have been done with this, e.g. exploring the huge battle cruisers.Speaking of failing to manipulate...the final scene didn't even rate as unintentionally funny, with that long, soapy gaze from an old character.On a positive note, the villain of this piece becomes interestingly complex in the last 30 odd minutes of this film, contributing to my higher score.Lastly, I'm surprised that the bad guys don't go broke in this galaxy...expensive infrastructure is a favourite of theirs!Disney's Neverending Story? I may lose interest in this franchise at some point then."
ID_100141;;I'm sorry for the inconvenience, but I need a text comment to predict the movie rating. Could you please provide one?;Well, where do I start. It's a parody of ANH. Watch Space Balls instead. Jar Jar Abrams wrote this after AA winning writer quit, presumably because Jar Jar wanted his name everywhere, he's a terrible writer, as well as a terrible director.Cast is terrible. Wooden acting for Rey, overacting for Finn. CGI is terrible for its time, that death star beam, terrible. That tentacle monster, terrible. Practical effects were hyped but barely used in the movie, when there were, CG were rendered on top. Looks crap.Sound, not much originality there. It's called in. It only broke records and box office because of the non stop hype nostalgia train, after people got on they soon realized what a sub par movie this is. Disney won't be so lucky next time.They will not get their $4b investment back. Some are Disney stock which has increase after the SW acquisition, so it's more like $6.xb. Better sell soon George.
ID_100147;;I'm sorry for the inconvenience, but I need a text comment to predict the movie rating. Could you please provide one?;People are looking at this pile of crap with rose colored glasses , nostalgia is a powerful thing it seems, This movie might appeal to sub 12 year crowd but I cant see a lucid adult sitting through it (unless they came with their kids ) I just saw it and was flabbergasted how bad it was , I actually thought it would be better (silly me) in fact its as bad as the Lucas piles of CGI crap that preceded it . The acting is atrocious , the story sux and the actors (bar Harrison Ford) are dilettantes . I'd give it about 5.0 which is what I think it will be whittled down to once people wake up from their nostalgic stupor .
ID_100152;6;6.9;"Hypocritical marketing and lazy writing took the magic from Star Wars.I'm not disappointed with this movie, I just move on. Furthermore I believe this is what a lot of other Cinephils and probably some ""Star Wars"" Fans are going to do as well. Not a problem for Disney, for sure. But as they don't give a s---,I'm now ""forced"" to do the same.Funny thing is, I convinced my 10 year younger girlfriend to watch the midnight screening for this, because I had hoped after reading Disney is going to take this seriously, even with a whole story-group overlooking the new movies, where there are more women involved would be really interesting. Turns out some old guys like Ridley Scott, George Miller, a middle aged Tarantino and even George Lucas himself to some extent in his OT, are far more capable when it comes to write strong believable female characters.After Mad Max Fury Road we talked the whole night about that movie until we had sexual intercourse, after the Force awakens we proceeded right to the juicy bit, without much talk. I'm one of those guys who likes both intercourse and conversation, figure yourself which movie my girlfriend was really in awe with and in which she was bored to sleep.I loved JJ Abrams Star Trek for what it is, I can have fun with such stuff, if it's done right. But, well... He made such a fool of himself here, it's kinda funny really, because of the marketing, NOT because of the movie. Movie was average, nothing to talk about really, but because of the insulting marketing. Movie target group could be considered uneducated teenagers with a lot of money, the marketing not so. Should be remembered. The ""professional"" critics *cough* must not be forgotten. I imagine a hard life to be chained to whatever you think you're chained to.I'm so proud about my girlfriend now, even more than before, that I really have to thank Disney and JJ for this. As intended? Hehe, I don't think so. What does a Kiri Hart or Kathleen Kennedy see in their mirrors now? Well probably dollars or something, I guess.To all those,"" IT FEELS LIKE STAR WARS!!1"" 10 stars reviews. You should watch some adds featuring Star Wars, they feel like Star Wars. A movie with the tag Star Wars should for sure not just feel like it, it should be plain Star Wars and not only felt alike. Enjoy it nonetheless, which is fine for me. Live and let live. That's diversity.Mathhew Vaughn is the only director here, who gained a lot of credit because of Star Wars The Force Awakens. The initiated will know why.Star Wars TFA 6,9/10 good scifi-fantasy, nothing more, perhaps less."
ID_100157;7;I'm sorry for the inconvenience, but I need a text comment to predict the movie rating. Could you please provide one?;"Episode IV was seen on an European beach movie theater in 1978, real stars in the sky, fake stars on the screen. It was unbelievable, purely magic. 1981 ""the Empire strikes back"" was released, new creations, especially ""Yoda"" and the new empire spaceships, planet Hoth, the city in the clouds etc... Episode VI was a panting expectation. Released in 1983, many critics saw it as weak. Still, new creations like the Ewoks or the woods vehicles were to see. The saga was almost finished. The galaxy was at peace.Episode 1 to 3 were also an attempt to create, sometimes very clumsy though. A very poor Darth Vader young man, but good Ewan McGregor and Natalie Portman, new things were also to discover, like Boba Fett father, new space vehicles, undersea world...But what is wrong with Episode VII ? Everything. Nothing is new, no creation at all. You take the best of Episode IV to VI, remixes it with a couple of new characters like the wonderful Rey (she is really good), you add in your salad a new emperor and his new disciple, a pathetic Darth.. what ? Son of Han Solo. Then, a coloured actor who is fully lost (Finn), and a new cute robot. That's it. The technical side is of course perfect. It is indeed. I do not believe George Lucas has appreciated the finality.It is said that we are 30 years after episode VI. What has changed in 30 years ? Nothing, the spaceships are the same (my car brand has evolved in this long time), imperial destroyers, imperial fighters, rebel X-Wings fighters are identical. We add a new so called Jabba, a new Cantina and a new death star on top and the salad is done.Ridiculous at most. What is the target of the makers ? Money of course, they reach the kids and drag the original fans to the movie theaters, like me. From 7 to 77 as Hergé said. Good move, bad movie ! Seven points for the technique."
ID_100158;8;I'm sorry for the inconvenience, but I need a text comment to predict the movie rating. Could you please provide one?;"I was seven when I first watched Star Wars (1977). Like many nineties kids' I watched the beloved first trilogy on VHS, in the days before George Lucas's Industrial Light and Magic had its way with the ""Deluxe DVD"" modified version. The space saga of Luke an Leia was never bestowed upon me by my parents with fond memories of the premiere. My mother, though fond of musicals, was not much for sci-fi or action movies; my father even less so. It was my older brothers who first sat me down to gaze upon its glory and since those days, every space adventure I have watched over the years lives or dies on the standard of the Star Wars.I say all this not only to lay out my fandom bonafides but also to highlight that my thoughts of Star Wars: The Force Awakens comes from a contemplative place and not the blather of a movie snob or a knee- jerk reaction to the whims of the crowd. I, among others have been burned by this franchise before and repeated viewings of the prequels only serves to underline a simple truth; not everything your loved when you were a teenager was good. So the question now is will this continuation of a long time ago, in a galaxy far away be re-watchable a decade from now?I short yes. Star Wars: The Force Awakens is a glorious epic of enormous beauty and scale. The pulse-pounding action, the unabashedly sincere characters and the small smatterings of brevity work to be the kick in the pants movies of this ilk have needed for decades. The welcome return of familiar faces liberally mixed with new and interesting characters gives the franchise all the ammo it needs to become the primary movie franchise for a whole new generations of padawans. The stakes are just as high, the acting is just as strong and the direction is just as flawless.The fact that everything works is no accident either. Director J.J. Abrams very purposely set up all the pieces of his puzzle with similar aplomb as the original creators (George Lucas, Gay Kurtz, Gilbert Taylor et al.). In many cases Abrams even used the same pieces. The score is still provided by the illustrious John Williams, the film itself was shot in the same aspect ration on 35mm film and emphasis was given to practical special effects over computer generated. Also on-board was original scribe for The Empire Strikes Back (1980) Lawrence Kasdan who co-wrote Force Awakens with Abrams.This is where there are some unfortunate kinks in the armor however. As irreproachable as we feel the originals are, they are not in-fact flawless. Thus much of the problems that plague the originals also plague Force Awakens specifically the dialogue and characterization. Daisy Ridley and John Boyega do a fine job finding the deeper meanings of the force/dark side, even when the story needs them to act against their own self interest (their love patter leave much to be desired however). Adam Driver's Kylo Ren on the other hand seems to falter not just under the wait of the franchises most iconic villain, Darth Vader but under the weight of his character's conflicts. Darth Vader never needed to throw a hissy fit with a lightsaber; a cold dead look was enough to make us think he was serious. My guess is in the sequels to come, a rift between him and Domhnall Gleeson's General Hux will solidify Kylo Ren as the sinister force he needs to be.In that lies the future success of the Star Wars franchise; what happens next? J.J. Abrams has a tendency to leave absolutely everything out on the field thus the reason why Alias (2001-2006), Lost (2004-2010) and Fringe (2008-2013) all petered into rambling shadows of their former selves. Likewise, the fantastical wonder that was Star Trek (2009) hit a creative deja vu by the time Star Trek: Into Darkness (2013) arrived on the scene. In this case however, I think there's more, much more to the saga than an almost surgical emulation of the originals. Abrams is building something, something big and it's going places."

Could you please provide one?;Ok, so Disney have got their hands on the Star Wars franchise and too many people don't like it - BOO HOO!Born in 1975 I grew up with Star Wars in my DNA, and I realise that nothing will ever match the scale and success of the original trilogy, but don't hate this for doing it's best!All the new characters work! They appeal to a new audience and they are humorous and very cool. Nostalgia is abundant with the return of Han, Leia and Chewy! What's not to enjoy????Littered with epic scenes this movie builds a new Star Wars world with a new threat born out of the old evil empire. Yes it's similar, but does that really make it bad???? The tech has evolved along realistic timelines to deliver more powerful weapons that aren't too different to the old weapons, is that really so bad???To score this movie with 1 or 2 stars is a joke, so along with the movie why don't you all hate this review and vote it down. Or you could simply stop watching these movies if you all hate them so much!If, like me, you can unplug and enjoy Star Wars again then watch this and enjoy it. It's far better than the haters say it is!9/10
ID_100160;10;I'm sorry for the inconvenience, but I need a text comment to predict the movie rating. Could you please provide one?;"Let's get one thing straight: the plot is derivative. There are tons of parallels to Star Wars: A New Hope, and pretty much the same events are going on.But what I was most surprised about was that I didn't care. I've talked with friends who have also seen it, and our consensus was that that part was obvious, but that none of us care. The reason why is because it was so well executed, and the new stuff brought to the table was probably the best parts of the movie.For starters, let's talk the new characters, because they're the main focus: they're fantastic. Rey was an awesome and inspiring lead. Finn was fearless if not naive and brought so much enthusiasm to the movie throughout. BB-8 was surprisingly absolutely adorable--to give any examples of his behavior would be to spoil some really charming moments. Poe was a pleasant surprise, because the trailers didn't show him off much but he was an absolute joy to watch. Captain Phasma is my only complaint--heavily underutilized in this movie.The big standout for me, however, was Adam Driver as Kylo Ren. Let it be known: he is NOT Vader 2.0. He doesn't try to be Vader 2.0. To go any further would be to spoil the movie, but trust me, he's one of the most interesting characters to come out of Star Wars in a long time.The old cast returns and is given amazing justice. This isn't them returning right back to their characters--this is them embodying their characters as they are decades later. Harrison Ford in particular was brilliant in his role and mannerisms.Visual effects: Outstanding. For the most part, the movie uses practical effects, and it really shows, because the movie is super engaging throughout its duration. Try to compare some of these scenes to those in any in the Star Wars prequels, and you'll see what I mean. Once again, I can't spoil details. It's funny, because there are only a handful of creatures and moments that use CG effects, and those are the ones that end up sticking out.Writing: Also super well done. A big flaw in the prequels is that everything got mired in unnecessary and redundant details. The most quoted lines from the prequels are most often the ones that are so stupid it's hard not to forget them (the sand monologue, for example). Meanwhile, everyone I've seen can't stop quoting random pieces of dialogue from the new movie that are so well done and so memorable. The dialogue is interesting, feels real, and leaves for some amazing one-liners--super reminiscent of the original trilogy in that way.Story: As I mentioned, yes it's derivative, but that doesn't mean it's not done super well. Plus, the scenes that have no parallels to A New Hope are some of the best in the movie. Much of the final act, for example, is not easily paralleled, and I was kept on the edge of my seat pretty much the entire movie. People here seem to be criticizing the movie for it's ""plot holes"". Most of these aren't even plot holes though! They're so explicitly left as mysteries so they can be answered and expanded upon in the next movie! Which is what's making people super excited for the next movie already!Also, my biggest complaint with J.J. Abrams' other works is how convoluted and roundabout they get. But Star Wars is meant to have much more straightforward stories (also something the prequels with the exception of ROTS were not good at). J.J. Abrams seems to have acknowledged this because this movie definitely feels like Star Wars in its far more straightforward approach. It feels much less confused and mired in details, and always seems to keep the main plot line going.Music: It's John Williams. It's memorable. Especially after seeing the movie a second time. It feels like Star Wars, and it enhances every moment wonderfully.Lightsabers: Okay, so without spoiling anything, I will say that the lightsaber fights in this movie will blow you away. They're big, dangerous, brutal, emotive, natural, and use the environments in super interesting ways. The fights in this movie are some of the best fights I've seen in the series history.Conclusion: Like I said, the plot frame is the same as A New Hope's. In many respects, it is the same. But it feels different than ANH, and yet it still feels like Star Wars. And it is executed so well that it was hard to even care that it followed the same frame. And the best parts of the movie are the new parts. The movie is intended to return to the heart and soul that made Star Wars so great in the first place, and it succeeds at that with flying colors. Engaging dialogue, great one-liners, awesome action sequences, a great character-driven plot, and a general captivation by the galaxy far, far away.Also, keep in mind, I made sure to write this review only after a few days of heavily considering all of the elements of this movie, and after seeing the movie a second time. My opinion hasn't changed. In fact, it got even better (originally I gave this movie a 9).Note, however: Now that the series is re-grounded in excellency, it's up to Rian Johnson to create an Episode VIII that takes the series to completely new places with a brand new plot based on all the brand new things this movie has brought to the table. If it doesn't, then Episode VII will be remembered as the film that spawned a rehashed series. If it does, however, then Episode VII will be remembered as an excellently-executed reintroduction to the series that had been long lost in a ""meh"" prequel trilogy and some very questionable Expanded Universe decisions (with the exception of stories like Thrawn and Revan)."

But these reviewers are just amateurs who try to bash a great movie. What did the professional reviewers write? USA Today 4 out of 4 stars, the Guardian 5 out of 5 Stars, The SF Chronicle 5 out of 5 stars, The Wall Street Journal 5 out of 5 stars, the headline - ""The Star Wars you have been waiting for"". If the movie is as bad as the amateur critics on IMDb states, why does it have an 8.1 rating here? Why did this movie gross over $2 billion dollars if word of mouth regarding the flick mirrored the crappy reviews found on IMDb? These reviewers who tell you that The Force Awakens it is a bad flick are just bitter people who live in the basement of their moms' home. I have seen the movie twice including IMAX and love it. The movie is 150 minutes long but feels 90 minutes. It's a great film – the two best movies of 2015 were Mad Max and The Force Awakens."

It also provides the audience with intriguing questions about the characters of this film.However, this films relies heavily on the overall feel of the Original Trilogy, evident in its plot that resembles that if A New Hope.In conclusion, this is a fun and interesting film to watch, however, it's dependence on the Original Trilogy material may be limits to the creativity and rewatchability of the film.
ID_100174;10;I'm sorry for the inconvenience, but I need a text comment to predict the movie rating. Could you please provide one?;This movie was fantastic. The new characters we receive are fun and interesting, and we are left to see them fleshed out more as the series continues, which is exciting. The movie is very reminiscent of the Original Trilogy. We have a decent amount of aliens (almost all of which are seen using costumes as opposed to CGI). The plot moves along at a great pace. Nothing is really dragged out, but at the same time it is not so fast that you are left confused. And speaking of confusion, there was none in this movie. It was all very straightforward and everything was very easy to understand. This movie absolutely pays homage to the original from 1977 in many ways, but at the same time I feel that you do not need an in depth knowledge of the previous movies to love this one. A general knowledge of the plot and main characters is all that is needed going into this movie. I will have to see it again to make sure, but at the moment this movie is vying for my favorite Star Wars movie ever with The Empire Strikes Back. But don't take my word for this - go out and experience it for yourself. You will have a delightful time filled with comedy, excitement, action, epic plot reveals, and an overall enjoyable time!EDIT SO I CAN RANT: The people who are giving this one or two stars (for the most part) are being overly critical of this movie. I understand not LOVING this movie, and even perhaps if you felt disappointed because it was not what you were hoping for. But regardless of that, it is impossible not to find SOME aspects you liked. There is comedy, action, and adventure. Even if you feel the movie is a reboot of the original (which to some degrees I may even agree), it was a good movie nonetheless. I have seen some comments dissing the acting, which I strongly disagree on. The acting was great! Maybe not perfect, but definitely enjoyable. John Boyega blew me away, Oscar Isaac was fun, and I absolutely ADORE Daisy Ridley. Harrison Ford was AMAZING as always! He really recaptured Han Solo for this movie. Is this a perfect movie? No, it falls into some traps that all movies fall into. That being said, it is still a fantastic film! Is this a good Star Wars movie? It depends, if you are going into this without considering there will be two more, you will probably be upset and say you won't even bother to see the next two. I feel like this movie spent a lot of time recapturing the originals NOT to BE the originals, but to re-establish those feelings in order to set us up for the bigger picture which will be shown to us through two more movies. Some questions are not answered, but again, we have to wait for the next two to come out before we judge this first one for that. This movie deserves an average/above average rating, and by my personal feelings, I still stand by my 10/10. It DOES NOT deserve the 1, 2, 3 and 4 out of 10 scores I have been seeing. That is just being too judgmental and not open to the continuation of a great series. 5+ ratings, in my opinion, have the best reviews, and really help explain what they did and did not like. This movie has A LOT to offer, and if you go in with an open mind, you won't be disappointed.
ID_100175;8;I'm sorry for the inconvenience, but I need a text comment to predict the movie rating. Could you please provide one?;Seems that everyone either loves or hates this movie. While some people think it's the best star wars, others think it's the worst. I'm in the middle. It's a great film, but far from the best star wars. Better than the prequels, and I even thought it was better than ROTJ. So for me it's the 3rd best star wars film, but it's still a really well made film. It's acted and wrote well, which Rouge one is not. The series needed this refresh, which is why I am mostly okay with the rehashed story. Still, the characters are well written and acted, and the visual effects are stunning

Thanks to Disney's purchase of Lucasfilm we have been gifted a new movie and all the excitement and anxiousness that comes with it. And while it has only been 10 years since the last new ""Star Wars,"" it has been more than 30 years of wondering what happens to the beloved characters of the original trilogy after ""Return of the Jedi."" And so, it is at times a teary-eyed delight to see these old friends return to the big screen. Therefore, before a single trailer surfaced, ""The Force Awakens"" was rife with nostalgia, and few directors understand the sensitivities of nostalgia the way J.J. Abrams does. His film ""Super 8"" was an exercise in '80s nostalgia and his reboot of the ""Star Trek"" franchise also demonstrated respect for decades-old and beloved sci fi/fantasy with massive, dedicated followings. It made him the clear choice – and the safest choice – for ""Star Wars: Episode VII.""In collaboration with writer Lawrence Kasdan (""The Empire Strikes Back,"" ""Return of the Jedi"") and based on some work from Oscar- winner Michael Arndt, Abrams crafts a new ""Star Wars"" chapter that is in turn very safe, but safe in the way of warm old blanket that has been patched back up with some new fabric. Abrams and Kasdan identify and distill classic ""Star Wars"" tropes and re-forge them into a new movie, sometimes down to even the plot details. The result is a constant feeling of familiarity coursing throughout the film and branding it as unequivocally ""Star Wars."" Even many of George Lucas' directing hallmarks are adapted in a show of humble reverence.This was, in many ways, a strategic first move back into ""Star Wars"" by Abrams and producer Kathleen Kennedy because it makes ""The Force Awakens"" somewhat impervious to criticism. By sticking so closely to the formula of old ""Star Wars"" films, the choice for the creative direction can be attributed to homage. That's how you appease fans – they can't complain if what you give them is a near replica of what they fell in love with in the first place.""The Force Awakens"" is truly a film for the fans in this way, with new characters and ideas introduced with a measure of subtlety. The inclusion of Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher and Mark Hamill along with Chewbacca, C-3PO and R2-D2 serve not only the purpose of appeasing fans, but also as a way to transition the story to the new characters, a passing of the torch, of sorts. These folks – ace pilot Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac), stormtrooper-turned-hero Finn (John Boyega), skilled scavenger Rey (Daisy Ridley) and the adorable ball droid BB-8 – are the real gems of ""The Force Awakens"" in their performances and characters (not unlike the fresh faces of ""A New Hope"" at one time were) and will take future episodes to great new corners of the galaxy. What feels new – or what Abrams adds to the ""Star Wars"" universe – is a greater sense of danger and an appropriate degree of complexity. I wouldn't call ""The Force Awakens"" violent, but there's an added realism and grit to the violence to the action sequences of this film that Lucas seemed to avoid in all six previous episodes – and it makes a difference. There's so much more tension and suspense. Adam Driver as Kylo Ren also brings an element of unpredictability and complexity to the pantheon of ""Star Wars"" villains, who have usually been very stoic, enigmatic and dignified. Ren is none of these, though arguably he aspires to be.But complexity doesn't necessarily translate to depth. ""The Force Awakens"" comes off as purposefully vague at times (about character history and anything that's happened in the last 30 years) and doesn't linger on one idea or in one place for very long. The story moves at hyper-speed, as if by avoiding any stationary activity it can stave off the many questions the audience will surely have about, well, everything. It wants to be fun and exciting, not bog you down with details about how the First Order came to power, what went on between Leia and Han since we last saw them, why the Rebellion is now the Resistance, etc. The most common negatively inclined thought one will probably have throughout the film or after is: ""I expected there to be something more to that."" And that's probably what Abrams preferred. Better you should be upset with something you wanted to see because it means you were intrigued, than because something was in the movie that you despised. Whatever questions you had, whatever characters you wanted to know more about or see more of, can be addressed in the next two films. It's a smart move.But most importantly, Abrams puts the emphasis back on the characters and that's why ""The Force Awakens"" works and will win audiences over. The actors and the story give us enough of the characters to care about their journey, in the same way we did in ""A New Hope."" That's the essence of ""Star Wars"" and that's why fans will be clamoring for ""Episode VIII."" ~Steven CThanks for reading! Visit Movie Muse Reviews for more"
ID_100185;8;I'm sorry for the inconvenience, but I need a text comment to predict the movie rating. Could you please provide one?;This is my review for Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens (spoiler free).This film delivers well to fans of all ages and is the sequel fans have been waiting for, for 32 years. With amazing dialogue and explosive special effects I promise that when you leave the theater you won't be disappointed. Let's start with some the good points of why I think this is the film of the year: 1. Characters: This film has some new characters like Finn (John Boyega), Rey (Daisy Ridley) and Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac), Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) these characters deliver the plot of the film well along with some the older characters like Han Solo, Princess Leia, Chebacca and C-3PO.2. Plot: This films plot follows the plot form Episode VI Return of the Jedi and is a very good continuation to the story.3. Special Effects: The special effects are explosive and are a key element to the film to make this a hell of a sci-fi epic.Those are the good points on why I think you should watch this film and the bad points well there are none because this film was enjoyable from beginning to end. I think that the force has truly awakened in this film but that's for you to judge. If you are a Star Wars fan old or new this film should be at the top of your list. 10/10 an excellent must see bring on Dec 2017 for Episode VIII. Must see.
ID_100189;8;I'm sorry for the confusion, but I need a text comment to predict the movie rating. Could you please provide one?;The force truly has awakened! Any one who is even a casual fan of Star Wars will tell you that this movie is the very essence of what Star Wars stands for in all of its wondrous glory. The cast was very well selected, it's very clear that they selected the right people to populate the new generation of the universe, and that J.J. Abrams is, indeed, the man for the job. It really comes as no surprise that Abrams was able to do the series justice, but it was indeed refreshing to see to what extent. The scenery was so amazing, and the new planets, while the terrain was not exactly original, Jakku was kind of a clone to Tatooine, but the village was vastly different to that of anything from the originals, or the prequels. If the fans will be very honest with themselves, these planets were refreshing in a very, very grim way. Then there's the story, while it was not entirely original, it did bring about the necessary setting and development to help us along with our new characters and their full introductions, as well as a deeper look into their psyches. Not to mention a revisit from our main cast in the originals. Though it may seem a little forced (no pun intended), it did not hinder the story in any way, in fact much of it was very much needed.The film itself was gripping in every positive manner, and there were even some genuinely hysterical moments! It didn't need to dumb it down for children, as there is proof that even some of the younger kids liked, even loved this movie, and there were sounds of begging for their mothers to bring them back to see it again. Take that Jar Jar, you old HACK! Now, let's get down to brass tax, was it good? Yes. Was it great? YES! Was it as good as the first one? Well, break my skull if you want, but YES YES YES it was actually just as good as the first trilogy, and that is coming from someone who grew up with the original trilogy on VHS. It was amazing. We are very fortunate to have the opportunity to see it in theaters, and own it on Blu-Ray, and we much NOT let that chance get away from us. So what are you doing still reading this review? GO SEE IT!!!!

Last night we were standing in line and you could feel the anxiety of everyone looking forward to this film.THIS IS THE BEST STAR WARS YET!Let me tell you why...All the actors can act - Everyone from Daisy Ridley to Adam Driver gave stunning performances. It's the first Star Wars movie I have ever seen where the acting was worthy all around.Great Directing - The only movie that can rival this one as far as directing goes was Empire. They are both on the same level. Needless to say this movie is leaps and bounds beyond the prequels. Great job JJ!It's Funny - Remember watching Jar Jar Binks and wanting to punch a hole in something? There is none of that nonsense in this movie. There are lot's of laughs and it has the same comedic value of the originals.Great Action! Action, and more Action!There are a few twists and a few tears to be shed. I honestly felt emotion while watching this movie. And that hasn't happened since the Empire Strikes Back. Everyone leaving the theater also loved the movie... You can usually tell an audience reaction to a movie by their interaction... and they were loud!
ID_100210;9;I'm sorry for the inconvenience, but I need a text comment to predict the movie rating. Could you please provide one?;"Let me start by saying: Wow! J.J. Abrams did it again! Like Star Trek before it, Star Wars is ready to take old and new generations of fans on a new journey. This is probably THE Star Wars movie that most people have waited for since Return of the Jedi. But I have to be frank: I liked the prequels. Don't hold it against me. They have their fans, despite what some say and think. It was George Lucas' attempt to show the bigger picture, the politics of this Galaxy Far Far Away; how it not only revolved around the actions of a few individuals but entire populations and governments. And most importantly, how it could have become an evil Empire. At the very least it enabled us to look at the original films and Darth Vader from another perspective. Unfortunately, the depiction of that era took away a bit of the rugged, dirty and lived in environments and the small, personal storyline that hallmarked the old trilogy. And let's be clear: it is hard to make prequels very surprising and fresh, since we know how they end. Even Peter Jackson had to find that out the hard way.But, that said, I am very pleased to say that the old feeling is back in full Force. J.J. Abrams always said that he wanted to make a successor in the spirit of the old trilogy, and he succeeded. From Lost, Star Trek, Cloverfield and Super 8, we know how J.J. Abrams is a master in taking old and familiar elements and putting them back together in surprisingly fresh ways, which is exactly what he did here. We are back to a story of exploration, where unassuming heroes venture into unfamiliar territory, the same elements that made the original trilogy so exiting. Fans will be pleased that the road is paved with familiar sights, old friends, and dark, ominous locations which seem far removed from the clean look of the prequels. Politics are conspicuously left out, and the threat of danger is tangible throughout the movie. And a great cast of not-too-well-known actors understands the B- movie nature of the movie without overdoing it (somethings the prequels were notorious for, I'll admit).If I have to make one obvious point of criticism, it is that it may all feel a bit too familiar. In approaching the old atmosphere and plotting of the original Star Wars, the makers have spared no expense to hint, nod, wink, reference and pay homage to their favorite episodes. The prequels dared to take risks and got into directions that alienated a lot of fans. This episode is playing it much more safe, perhaps a bit too much. If I had a checklist, my guess would be that half the scenes contain a direct reference or re-used plot point from earlier in the series (some more blatant than others). The hardcore fans are guaranteed a nerdgasm virtually every 5 minutes, which explains the extremely favorable first reactions to the movie. At certain points it just becomes a bit too obvious that they want to remind us how cool they are by trying to imitate the cool kids. But, in all fairness, in the key scenes, it works just fine. There are unforgettable moments that make great use of the previously established legacy that is Star Wars, such as the chillingly solemn epilogue. And they haven't forgotten to bring it with a light touch (leave it to Han Solo and his hairy sidekick!). Some of the crowd-pleasing moments had me laugh, some were so über-geeky that they made me think AND laugh, and others made me cheer like a 9-year-old. And in the truly unique scenes, they manage to find a beating heart in the story, remind us of all the great moments that came before, and present things to keep us guessing for what is to come. This movie is a good continuation, a great stand-alone movie, as well as a promise for what is to come. Past, present and future well balanced. Can't wait for Episode VIII!"
ID_100221;10;I would need more specific feedback from the user to provide a rating. So far, it seems they are providing a summary of the movie rather than their personal opinion. Could you please clarify if they liked or disliked the film?;"Next stop on my Star Wars review series is the start on the new trilogy, The Force Awakens. This may have been the most anticipated film I have ever witnessed and I was so excited before seeing this for the first time in the cinema and now I have rewatched it and this is my review. The premise of the film sees an ex stormtrooper, a scavenger and two smugglers team up in an attempt to stop the new regime The First Order led by a powerful Dark Side user.Main Character
John Boyega plays Finn in this film, a former Stormtrooper who realises his mistakes and decides to leave The First Order and he is great in this film. The guy is just super charismatic in the role making him likeable but also he nails all of his dramatic scenes and he really delivers in making this character really interesting. At this point she was a newcomer but Daisy Ridley plays Rey in this film and she is also great, she is a really interesting character and she goes through a great journey through the film that takes twists and turns that are a bit suprising and a welcome suprise at that. The two's chemistry is very good and very natural making them a likeable pair of leads and great new leads for the franchise.Supporting Characters
Harrison Ford makes his return as Han Solo and he is really good, he is more of a mentor figure in the film and you can tell he has fun in the role. You can tell the version of this character has been through plenty since The Return Of The Jedi and it is told well by Ford as he gives a very good dramatic performance alongside the Han Solo charm. Now we get to possibly the best acting performance at the point of this film Adam Driver as Kylo Ren, I was absolutley enthralled by his performance in this film. He is a villain yes but it is great to see a villain with loads of depth and real drama to him. You can see throughout he struggles between the light and dark side and it did a better job then Anakin's arc in the prequel trilogy in this film alone. Domnhall Gleeson plays General Hux and he is a very good antagonist, he is similar to Tarkin in A New Hope as he plays the evil officer but he is so snivelling and power hungry that it works, I also liked the dynamic between him and Ren and added another side to the film. Oscar Isaac has a smaller but important role as Poe Dameron and he is really good. The chemistry between him and Boyega feels so natural and makes you like them straight away, you can tell he is trying to be the new Han Solo but it works and he is a very likeable person.Story
The story of the film is great, each of the main characters have really interesting plot threads which see their characters start at one point and develop and end somewhere completley different which shows great story structure. Yes this film has gained criticism for having similar plot elements to A New Hope and yeah they are there but I thought it was handled very effectively in this film, and with a film that connects very heavily to the original films it feels appropriate for the film to have a similar structure to that one. I also have to say the film has a great ending that at the time and even now gets you excited for what the sequel might bring.Script
The script for the film is a real positive, one obvious criticism of the prequel trilogy was just how bad the scripts were and how the dialogue made the characters feel like robots or boring but there is no issue with that here. The humour when used works and feels natural, the characters feel like regular people not robots, the drama also nails every level with one of the most emotional moments in Star Wars history happening in this film for sure.Style
The film's style looks fantastic, the action scenes are brilliant and will keep you on the edge of your seat. The lighstaber battle here feels less rehearsed and more personal then the prequels making them feel very intense and really dramatic which honestly I prefer in my lightsaber battles. The pacing of the film feels right and flows between character bits and action sequences really well to keep you interested and excited at the same time.Overall
Overall, I cannot stress how much fun I had watching this film, yes there may be a few small issues but overall my love for this film is huge as it creates a film that tries to move Star Wars forward while paying homage to the past and I think it really succeeds at that.Rating - 10/10."

Well, falling asleep twice within the first 90 minutes and not even being bothered to see the rest of this movie says a lot. Honestly, I'm short for words! Where is the innovation in this movie, where are the cool actors, and where is the new story line? Rather than calling this movie ""The force awakens"" this movie should have been called ""The force goes to sleep"". The only feeling I got during the first 90 minutes is a deepened feeling of deja-vu! The whole movie is just a rerun of the original Star Wars movie, but with one big difference: lousy acting, even lousier music, and the lousiest lamest story-line (doesn't even deserve the word story) of any movie I have ever seen, literally ever! This feels like Avatar all over again... the coolest 3D animations and special effects, each one worth 10/10, but there it all stopped for me. Is this Disney at its best? Is this really all about making money from preteens? Wow, you guys so under-wow and under- amaze me with this bull-crap. It feels good being able to watch the original Star Wars again (Nope, not part IV for me, but always part I, the only original from 1977). Maybe memories should stay just that... I just hope that someone on this planet can come up with something more interesting, entertaining and exciting than another one of these crappy sequels, because this - for me - has reached the limit of how much more of this nonsense I can take.Where are the next cool producers and directors who are daring to go where no one has gone before (no pun intended)?"

Have to say I loved it. It didn't feel like an Abrams film. It felt like a Star Wars film. I have grown up with Star Wars. I was nine when I went to the original ( I refuse to call it A New Hope ). Empire Strikes Back is my favourite film of all time and I don't care what the basement detractors say, I liked the prequels and they get an undeserved bad rap. They're movies, they're entertaining, get over it. The Force Awakens has everything you want in a Star Wars movie. The acting was good as was the action and special effects. If you're a fan you owe it to yourself to go see it. If you're a hater you probably still will and then spend the rest of your time on the net complaining how George Lucas raped your childhood and JJ is a hack. Don't listen to the haters go see it for yourself. You won't be disappointed. Footnote. Daisy Ridley sometimes looks scarily like Keira Knightly.

It's also an extremely popular and mainstream movie, and therefore is going to bring out people that will needlessly nitpick it to death in an attempt to look smart or edgy. There are legitimate criticisms you can hurl at this movie, but people that give it a 1 or 2/10 shouldn't be taken remotely seriously, as they are completely ignoring what the movie did right and putting a magnifying glass over a handful of beyond minor flaws.Star Wars fans will find a lot to love hear. Great set pieces/locations, excellent costume design, flawed and relatable characters, hilarious banter/quips, dramatic and complex relationships, and a ton of space adventure fun. It's the best Star Wars film since Empire, hands down.

Like the new characters.The story, however, was very safe and very predictable. Too much self reference and regurgitation of previous episodes. Not a bad movie, but it never really ""took off"" to me.I don't want to outright bash the movie, but it's really just ""ok"" - which is the inevitable result of a Disney committee forged product that strives to give fans exactly what they (think) they want, and try to satisfy every possible demographic to make it an eminently consumable product. And that's what it is. Lucas hit it on the head when he basically said ""yeah, people should like it.""You SHOULD LIKE IT. And I do. But I certainly don't love it."

Could you please provide one?;I can't believe it took someone 32 years to make a decent Star Wars movie. Finally, true fan and director J.J. Abrams gave us the film we have desperately been waiting for.The three main new characters were introduced in a great way that we loved them and cared for them in an instant. When any of the original characters showed up, everyone in the theater applauded.Everyone that reprises their role from the original trilogy were perfect, even the new coming leads did a great job.Remember those flashy, coordinated lightsaber duels we got in the previous six Star Wars films? Yeah, forget them cause the fight we got in The Force Awakens was brutal and dirty and excellent.It was everyone's dream to finally see The Millennium Falcon fly again with the use of the new technology of our time. I loved that the film respected the originals by using practical effects instead of special effects all the time (the prequels)Star Wars Episode VII: The Force Awakens is a great start to hopefully another trilogy (The Sequels) and even more Star Wars spin- offs.

""For idiots only"": should have been the advertisement. ""We WANT ONLY YOUR MONEY thanks to your stupidity"" Greedy makes people idiots... so Lucas began to ruin Star wars since the Return of the Jedi with little furry puppets able to face imperial army by arrows and spears. Then Lucas followed with a little child able to destroy a whole separatist frigate with a never managed tiny fighter and a simple shot (note that the ""heroes"" are always invulnerable and luckiest despite of enemies described always as imbeciles). All made to make easy money by marketing which takes advantage from emotional suggestions to sell stupid illusions considering viewer as IDIOTS. Finally Abrams arrived completing the dark plane of the Sith lord: the complete destruction of Star Wars icon so to make easy money selling a fascinating charming absolutely VOID to the dummies.The way to scam people strikes again.

Could you please provide one?;"Since the arrival of J.J Abrams to the star wars saga, it was clear that some; if not a lot was going to change.This change has been much unapreciated in the IMDb community, spawning a great number of negative reviews, calling it a remake rather than a sequel, however; this is not the case: the shared plotpoints and familiar themes from the original star wars trilogy are there to appeal to old star wars fans seeking a renassaince in the star wars saga after the disappointment of the prequels.J.J Abrams not only fooled most of the speculating media (example: Luke= Kylo Ren theory) but also gave us one of the best installments in the saga. Before you prepare your keyboards to make an immediate counterpoint, let me explain: ""The force awakens"" isn't anything incredibly new but rather refreshing, it bought a new approach at action sequences: awesome X-Wing piloting sequences, Dirty lightsaber fights and more blaster action (""nothing beats a good blaster at your side,kid"" -Han Solo). It gave us realistic and likable characters: Poe Dameron is a synonym of likable, Kylo Ren is a vulnerable human being under the mask; unlike darth vader and the emperor, and many beloved characters make a heartwarming return to the saga.The force awakens is innovative, but returns to the roots of the saga, taking out many ideas and themes from a new hope, empire strikes back and even return of the jedi. It's a breath of fresh air in the sci- fi and action department, a much needed one. Star wars: The force awakens is one of the best sci-fi/action flicks of 2015 and I hope to see more Star wars soon."

He uses his the FORCE instead, his INTUITION, and overcomes his families dark legacy. But only with the help of a friend/Han Solo who risked his life to save his friend beyond mere monetary reward. - good spiritual growth in the movie...which comes to a celebratory conclusion.In The Force Awakens, nobody destroys their families dark legacy by using their INTUITION (AWAKENED SELF) over machinery and tech - it was just a bunch of shooting at stuff. And the love that Han and Leia shared was rewarded with death and darkness.But i suppose that kind of story would emerge from a corporation that BOUGHT the story for financial gain, as opposed to creating a story for all to be AWAKENED by.
ID_100255;10;I'm sorry for the inconvenience, but I need a text comment to predict the movie rating. Could you please provide one?;30 years ago the incredible Star Wars trilogy came to an end, many didn't expect the return of the characters we grew to love and cherish, but now they have returned and JJ Abrams has given us back a world which shaped so many childhoods and i could not be happier. This review will be completely spoiler-free, which will be hard with so much to cover, but i will not be revealing anything here which you didn't already know from trailers.A very basic story outline is that we follow Rey and Finn, two characters who are quite similar in many ways, but who are so interesting to get to know. I won't be revealing anything else because if i do i will literally be treading into spoiler territory. First things first though, Harrison Ford as Han Solo. My god. Han Solo is my favourite character in the entire Star Wars saga. Harrison Ford does such a good job at bringing this character back that he alone shows us why we missed this universe so much. He wasn't shoehorned in either. He played a vital part in the plot and did the best job possible. I loved seeing him and Chewbacca, who was hilarious in this film, step onto the Millennium Falcon for the first time. When the opening title crawl came onto the screen with the iconic John Williams theme playing through the IMAX speaker system my heart swelled with nostalgia and my eyes filled with tears. This was a moment i never expected to see and it could not have been done in a better way. The same goes for Han and Chewie stepping onto the falcon. It was just that good.That being said, the main cast of newcomers were incredible. John Boyega's Finn is such a relatable character who has done wrong and just wants to right that and Oscar Issac as Poe was just the most likable guy ever. But my favourite character in the entire film was Rey. I love Daisy Ridley, she is such a likable person and I had every faith that she would make this role her own and completely shine in this film.. which she did. Getting to know Rey as a character turned out to be the most interesting part of this film for me, which is saying a lot because A LOT happens. As well as this we have our new 'Empire' who are known as the First Order. Adam Driver as Kylo Ren was also such a joy to watch. He didn't just play this bad character who was bad for the sake of it. He had real human emotion. He played the character as someone who was fearful and had a sort of emotional vibe which set him apart from other villains in the saga. I was however disappointed by the lack of anything Captain Phasma does in this film.. she is literally the new Boba Fett. Im not saying that is a bad thing, i was just expecting her to do more.I saw this film in IMAX. The locations and set design are stunning. There is a scene where Rey is introduced on Jakku and we see the area, it is so well shot that i felt there and was literally amazed by what i was seeing. I also like the high use of Practical effects. Almost every character we see is practical, whereas others who are CGI such as Maz Kanata (motion capture) look so real that they don't feel out of place. But a lot of praise for going back to the original route of using mostly practical effects. A lot of people say this is too similar to the original Star Wars film, whilst the last act is pretty similar, this film did feel like its own film at the same time. Some characters such as C3PO and R2D2 feel kind of like if they weren't there it wouldn't make a difference, but like i said new characters really feel at home here. BB8 had a lot of great moments which were real highlights of the film, he also played a huge part in the plot of this film which surprised me.But all-in-all what can i say except, thank you JJ Abrams. This film makes us realise why we missed this universe so damn much. From seeing the Falcon take flight for the first time, to seeing Han and Leia reunite for the first time, it warmed my heart as a huge Star Wars fan and i smiled almost the whole time in this film. There are a few real emotionally heart wrenching scenes too though. I laughed, i cried and having the franchise in the hands of newcomers Daisy Ridley and John Boyega as well as Oscar Isaac, well i am just okay with that. They have bright careers ahead of them and they have really proved themselves. This is the best in the saga since The Empire Strikes Back and i cant wait to see where this story is heading, as well as seeing this film again. May the force be with you
ID_100262;9;I'm sorry for the inconvenience, but I need a text comment to predict the movie rating. Could you please provide one?;Im not a particularly a big fan of the Star Wars franchise. For a long time I found the Revenge of the Sith the most enjoyable of the lot. A New Hope and Return of the Jedi were probably the best of the series in terms of story, tone and humour. Thats until now. Screw nostalgia, the only thing which made the originals good is the time of its release and how revolutionary the trilogy was. The Revenge of the Sith had far much more action and story progression. But The Force Awakens blows it out of the water for action. Humour is a little more grown up and much less cheesy. It does seem like the same old rebels attach the spaceship scene which was the focal point of new hope and empire strikes back. And another lovechild turns bad so for originality its lacking in the plot. It does have a good tone in terms of the legend of the force and all the stories of the great battle. The First Order has emerged welcomingly however and I look forward to a much more grown up series with action like this one.

Could you please provide one?;Star Wars fans and fans of baggage free thrill ride blockbusters for all ages rejoice as not only is the Force Awakens the return to the galaxy far far away we've been waiting these many long years for this is a Star Wars film that just could well be the most unarguably well made of the entire beloved series.Master of entertainment J.J Abrams film is an event film that puts many other big budgeted extravaganzas to shame with a near perfectly paced plotted narrative, rip roaring old school action that moulds the new with the old seamlessly, heavy doses of humour amongst the emotion and just a general sense of fun that flows through the very veins of Abrams and associates love letter to one of cinemas most beloved properties.With what seemed like the worlds expectations waiting with baited breathe on its shoulders, The Force Awakens successes of blending the old with the new and paying remembrances to past glories while also crafting its own its quite the feat and while it may not rip the rule book up and craft a totally unexpected or even an overly original story (a slight gripe is the 'dark sides' new major weapon which seems far too like devices of old), Star Wars has never been the film to craft a unique story of good vs evil, rather place it in a special place with special characters which The Force Awakens once more does to great effect.The original films found themselves so adored thanks to the rise of Luke Skywalker, the feistiness of Princess Leia, the friendship and adventures of the Millennium Falcon's Han Solo and Chewie and the battle they faced to save the universe and while all old cast mates from the films return here and do so extremely successfully in varying degrees of screen time – Han and Chewie especially, as they threaten to steal the show with their on point repertoire, Abrams has found a willing an effective batch of newcomers that will undoubtedly lead the property forward in an exciting way.While they may not be as instantly iconic as the first time we we saw the Luke's, the Leia's or the Hans, Daisy Ridleys determined and resourceful Rey, John Boyega's good natured Finn, Adam Drivers fearsome yet somehow sad big bad Kylo Ren and thankfully even the lovable and not overused BB8 quickly become new members of the universe that we can get to know, love and loathe and its great to rest on the fact that as our treasured original cast become far to old to continue their intergalactic battles these newest members of the series will be taking over the drivers seat as seen sometimes quite literally in this film.Particular mention must be made of Ridley and her turn as Rey, it's a star making turn and also a brave directional turn from the filmmakers to hand the mantle to a genuine unknown but both the actress and character are fantastic. Driver on the other hand is now a well known talent and his Kylo is a volatile, short tempered and even vulnerable villain that may alienate some fans but win an equal amount of new ones and every time he is on screen the film sizzles and his lightsaber is all types of epic.In regards purely to the story Abrams, Michael Arndt and series veteran Lawrence Kasdan have crafted there's again nothing overly new here but it's done in such a fun, fast paced and often breathtaking manner that it quite truly doesn't matter and there's moments to make the audience clap, cheer, jeer and even shed a tear and a few fabulously designed scenes and scenarios that will be sure to bring those goose-bump chills. It's also the film that suits itself to little pre-knowledge so going in with little story knowledge will make the experience that much more enjoyable.The Force Awakens is far from perfect yet when we take off our rose tinted glasses and forgo all nostalgia are any of the Star Wars films?The Force Awakens has delivered on the unparalleled hype and the high expectations that have encompassed it from the day it was announced from all corners of the globe and managed to be the film long serving fans, more recent appreciators and fresh recruits can all be taken away by.The force is indeed strong with this one so let the countdown begin for the next exciting chapter in this now safely back on track saga that looks set to live long and prosperously for years to come yet.4 1/2 Mad Dogs out of 5

Could you please provide one?;"The Force Awakens isn't perfect entertainment and we should all stop pretending Star Wars movies as a whole have to be flawless(The Prequel Trilogy also gets held up to that kind of scrutiny, as well as The Original Trilogy). They're not THE films by which ALL movies must be compared to; films like Sunset Boulevard or Citizen Kane are more suited for that purpose to compare movies to because they were benchmark films that set the stage for Hollywood movies then onward, even though they weren't films driven by special effects. Cinema is an evolving art form and it's bound to repeat some things. Is that really a bad thing especially when the film in question is only a 'soft-reboot' and not a shot-by-shot remake of the original? I say no: it isn't. The Force Awakens is a blockbuster that's derivative but progressive, familiar but fresh. It's not perfect but it's Star Wars through and through.Star Wars Episode VII: The Force Awakens was finally released in 2015 to audience, critical and commercial fanfare: it was named one of the AFI's Top 10 Films of 2015, grossed $U.S.2.07 billion at the global box office and was credited with revitalizing the Star Wars franchise. However, there were some ardent fans who criticized the film for its redundancies they wished weren't featured in the film, and I can understand those criticisms; I just don't agree with those who hold those issues against the film. The Force Awakens is an overdue visit from an old friend that you've been wanting to see again for years. And you find that the friend has made some notable changes since the last time you saw him. You see what was there before but you can also feel and embrace the new stuff as well; and that's very true for the story of The Force Awakens.The Force Awakens is a blast to watch: it's intergalactic fun that honors the previous movies beautifully and manages to feel new while strictly being a self-aware Star Wars romanticist's film made for people who grew up on The Original Trilogy.The Force Awakens gets 5/5 stars."
ID_100285;9;"I'm sorry for the confusion, but I need more information about the user's opinion to give a prediction. Could you please provide that? For example, ""Did they like it or not?""";"With the upcoming release of ""Star Wars: The Last Jedi"" i've decided to make a review of this movie.
""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" is a movie directed by J.J. Abrams and stars Daisy Ridley, Adam Driver, John Boyega, Oscar Isaac, Harrison Ford, and many more. This movie takes place after ""Return of the jedi"" back in 1983 and is about the resistance has to complete a very important mission for the destiny of the galaxy and the first order has to stop it. 
Let's talk about the positive things, the visual effects are fantastic. J.J. is a director that is known for his ability to combine the CGI effects and the practical ones at just the right level, and it shows. By the way this is a very well directed movie and very well edited too. All this together with John Williams's score, you do feel like Star Wars is more than back into the big screen.
The performances in this movie are some of the best of the entire saga with out a dude. John Boyega as Finn is fantastic and Daisy Ridley is magnificent as Rey. She is easily the best part of this movie. Adam Driver was awesome as Kylo Ren, one of the best movie villains in recent years. Harrison Ford as Han Solo is very good, and the friendship between Han and Chewie still there and is very fresh.
This is a very funny movie, in my opinion this is the funniest movie of the entire saga. And almost all the comedy comes from BB-8, which is awesome and i loved it in this film.
""Episode VII"" has some very good battle sequences and the sound mixing was great, you feel the action almost directly in your face and is awesome to see.
The easter eggs and references to the other Star Wars movies were also great, and there are shown with respect to the saga and the fans of the source material. I like the fact that the references there are not in the entire movie, which i'm very happy. Because this movie had a danger to doing that like ""Jurassic World"" did it that year, but thanks to the force, that didn't happened.
I loved this movie,but it does have some flaws. For example, Snoke and Maz Kanata. This movie has this two CGI characters here, but they don't matter all that much. There are scenes when we see Snoke talking to some people and is not that interesting or important. The same thing happened with Maz, she was and old lady who sometimes talks about other Star Wars things, but is not interesting. But, don't worry, there are not in the entire movie.
This movie is one for my favorites movies of Star Wars and it is i the 4th place in my ranking of the Star Wars movies. I've already watched ""The Last Jedi"" and is amazing, but I need to watch it a second time before i do the review. Those are my thoughts of ""Star Wars: Episode VII"" and thats way i'm going to give it a 9/10."

Could you please provide one?;"While this film is an improvement on some of the prequil movies such as Attack of the Clones, which were a disappointment, it lacks the soul and character the original 3 had.The plot was very vague and oversimplified and the character development was also lacking.However there were some great performances from Ridley and Boyega and of course Ford always delivers a good performance. It felt a little too much like a ""Disney"" film, although it was nice to see Carrie Fisher & Harrison Ford again. The movie feels too much like a Star Trek film and this is where Abram's influence shows. It was a mistake not to allow Lucas to direct. The movie did have its positive aspects and had great action and special effects. I think most fans are relieved that the movie didn't suck."
ID_100287;4;I'm sorry for the inconvenience, but I need a text comment to predict the movie rating. Could you please provide one?;I was shocked and pleasantly surprised to see the overwhelming number of negative reviews here, expecting the Star Wars fans to heap grandiose praises on it. There is little original here. The pacing is better than the prequels, the score still gives chills, and the effects reflect some of the improvements of late and the 3D, but the plot and dialogue is SO simplistic, and the movies length is out of proportion to the story itself, which is mostly a rehash of the original triad, updated. While there is no vulgarity, the dialogue is still aimed mainly at the middle school level, and the violence, while sanitized, is prevalent throughout. For die-hard fans, negative reviews will have no effect, but if you are not in that category, you aren't missing much if you miss this.
ID_100288;;I'm sorry for the inconvenience, but I need a text comment to predict the movie rating. Could you please provide one?;I find it absolutely sickening that I paid $15 for this crap. I went there with my g/f and halfway through it we had to leave because it was getting too painful to continue to watch. The theater was nearly full and there was a lot of nervous tension going around and when the opening script started to appear there was a huge round of cheers and my g/f lost by telling folks to quiet down because it was rude. The cheers lasted awhile and most of couldn't here the initial dialogue. The sad part was most folks were clueless on who the actual characters were and didn't understand when older characters appeared. I had to tell the d'bags next to me to shut-up because I didn't want to hear them anymore or the stupidity coming from their mouth. I doubt after this epic failure there will be another episode, with this crap Star Wars is pretty much dead and buried.

Could you please provide one?;"Star Wars VII: The Force Awakens (2015) -I really can't see why so many critics/so called ""Fans"" have such a beef with this film. Okay, so its promises weren't totally fulfilled in its two sequels, but this film delivered a new fresh take on the classic tale that we have always loved.It did rehash a lot of what had gone before, with a lost youth abandoned on a desert planet who was plunged in to being a part of the rebellion and even the outcome of this instalment was similar to that of Episode's IV (1977) and VI (1983) and some might also argue that Episode I (1999) had done exactly the same thing.But the symmetry and the repetition has always been a part of what I've liked about Star Wars. It has a ""Balance"" throughout and in fairness, these situations are likely to be true. When one merciless Empire is destroyed, another would likely rise from its ashes to keep the fight going and probably follow a lot of the same ideas of how to go about it all, building bigger and more powerful space stations that can cause more and more damage and the rebels would always rise up again to bring them down.Not only that but this film brought the fan's favourite franchise to a brand new audience, which only achieved even more longevity for the series that I have enjoyed for so long. A new generation could appreciate the modern touches that they might have found missing from the other six films that preceded it.There was action. It had adventure. It had romance and it had humour, there wasn't much more that I could need, except perhaps Poe (Oscar Isaac) and Finn/FN-2187 (John Boyega) in a compromising and naked clinch?Although some of the actors were a bit new, none of them really gave a bad performance and the more that I rewatch this one the more that I think that Domhnall Gleeson's weak General Hux character was more about the character actually being a snivelling toad than about the actor doing it badly and even Kylo Ren, played by Adam Driver was giving a good version of a wayward teenager gone astray and rebelling against his parents in a childish way. After all I wasn't supposed to like their personalities anyway.It was clear that Oscar Isaac as Poe was meant to take the action hero strain from Harrison Ford's Han Solo, who couldn't quite fight like he used to and obviously John Boyega's character of Finn and Rey, played by Daisy Ridley were the options to take the mantle of the latest Jedi, but which one?That just left a vacancy for someone to fill Carrie Fisher's role of Princess/General Leia Organa. Although she was still present in the storyline, someone had to take over her more feisty Princess responsibilities, so again it was a toss up between Finn and Rey. Ultimately I liked the decisions that they made and the way that the old generation was bridged to the new and actually the various traits from the older cast were actually spread around amongst the new and not swapped like for like entirely.BB-8 (Brian Herring & Dave Chapman) made another great addition as the roly-poly sphere droid, despite R2-D2 (??) and C-3PO (Antony Daniels) being available and perhaps that update was a refresh that was needed, with the general humour being spread throughout the cast rather than being mostly reserved for 3PO's old mother-like behaviour and R2's witty one liners.I also really liked the introduction of Maz Kanata (Lupita Nyong'o) and I was hoping to find out how she recovered Luke's lightsaber in one of the follow up films, but she was never used properly again sadly. I also wanted to know what Max Von Sydow's character, Lor San Tekka, felt so guilty about and how he had come to obtain the map that the whole story centred around.The other thing that I needed to know was where Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis) had originated from and how he came to have power over Kylo and The First Order. The rumour that he was the stormtrooper that banged its head in Episode IV: A New Hope, seemed a bit of a stretch just because of the scar on his head and I find it highly unlikely that his more recent character Kino Loy from 'Andor' (2022) was so upset about being left behind that he rose in power to lead the First Order.The First Order was born of the aftermath of the evil Empire and once again it was a small pocket of resistance that were determined to bring justice back to the galaxy. I personally thought that this team did a great job of establishing that and J. J. Abrams did a great job at relaunching the franchise as he had done with 'Star Trek' (2009). I just wish that he'd stayed to see it through for the films that followed on both counts, but this one was awesome.932.11/1000."

Could you please provide one?;Quickie Review:The Galactic Empire has fallen, but thirty years later from its ashes rises a new threat to The Republic. A rag-tag group of heroes and resistance fighters must come together to face The First Order and the dangerous new weapon they've built. Meanwhile, the mysterious figure known as Kylo Ren is on a mission to finish the journey to the dark side, following his idol Darth Vader. Star Wars TFA, is not perfect but it is the film the fans have been aching for. The focus is back on the characters and their relations, set in the grand operatic setting of Star Wars. Familiar heroes are back to bring out your nostalgia but more importantly the new cast make an impactful impression, leaving you excited to see more of them in the future films. TFA does traverse some familiar plots from the original story but sets the stage for exciting adventures ahead without sacrificing the thrill of this film. If you aren't one of the millions already seen the film in the first weekend, make sure you aren't missing out soon.Full Review:At work I've seemed to have built up a reputation of being a rabid fan of Star Wars. Though that's true, I am a huge fan of the franchise, the fandom all over the world goes far beyond. Considering the hate towards the prequels, many fans including myself had their hopes riding on TFA. Thankfully, the movie was able to re-capture the magic of the original Star Wars.While we do see some of our favourite characters returning, the focus of the movie is truly on the new cast. First of all, the two leading heroes Rey (Daisy Ridley) and Finn (Jon Boyega) are instantly likable. These are not the one note characters of the prequels, they are layered and have growth that feels natural. Their charming personalities had me invested in the perils they are thrusted into. On the darker end, we have Kylo Ren so wonderfully portrayed by Adam Driver. He deserves the honour of being a great addition to Star Wars hall of villainy. In just one film I got to know so much about his conflicts and ambitions. Yet at the same time there is still a veil of mystery on the character, an intrigue behind him that I can't wait to see be explored more in the later films. We also get to see more characters from the original trilogy, the highlight of which was Han Solo. At no point did it feel like he was just playing this role again for some easy cash. He was right at home playing Han which made it all the more fun for me to watch him return to this beloved franchise. Other recognisable icons are used in a smart way, with moderation as to not grab the attention away from the story.Aside from the great cast, I enjoyed the way the film was shot. One of the biggest point of their marketing was the use of practical effects, and it pays off. I will make the claim now, this film will age much better than the prequels, because everything feels authentic and tangible. The practical effects brought a sense of realism to the fantasy of this world. The action scenes were beautifully shot with all the dogfights and gunfights getting your blood pumping. On top of that I loved the light sabre fights. There are no fancy CGI jumps and twirls, instead it was a messy fight for survival, driven purely by rage and fear. These weren't scenes for just spectacle but ones that furthered the growth of the characters involved, a critical moment in their journey with the Force. I'd like to say more about some scenes that I feel will become iconic in the future but I will leave that for you to experience.Though I loved the film, it is not perfect. The main issue it comes down to is the fact there are too many similar story points in TFA borrowed directly from the original trilogy. So for the most part the movie plays it quite safe. At the same time my main complain of the prequels was that they don't feel like a Star Wars adventure. However, TFA does capture that sense of magic and adventure of Star Wars, so in a way borrowing the story elements did help. Moving forwards I'd like to see newer ideas come into play but that's something to discuss in 1.5 years from now (let the countdown begin for Episode 8!).Again if you aren't one of the millions who have rushed out to see it, don't wait too long. Go now and experience what we've always loved about Star Wars, great heroes, great villains, great action, and great mythology. Star Wars The Force Awakens gives me confidence in the future of this franchise.
ID_100291;8;I'm sorry for the inconvenience, but I need a text comment to predict the movie rating. Could you please provide one?;I know, I know, Please don't kill me, although I see that some of you agree.I will say this, I actually loved the new characters that were made for this generation of Star Wars. Fin acts a lot like a Star Wars fan trapped in a Star Wars movie and his origin was pretty cool. His chemistry with Rey was dynamic and to be blunt, it's good to see a strong female character in a Star Wars movie other than Princess Leia(who I loved in this movie as well). Poe Dameron was a great character as well. He looks like a carbon copy of Hon Solo and that would have been the case if it were played by anyone one else other than Oscar Issac. I even like Adam Driver as the Dark warrior Kylo Ren. I could go on and on with the many supporting characters, but I won't. Let's just say they all were developed well from the biggest to the trivial.And speaking of Trivial, the attention to detail was amazing. It was not just quick scenes in the movie that would make Star Wars fans eyebrows raise when they realize the Easter egg they caught, but it looks like they add cool stuff that would make new fans go ga ga twenty years from now. And the movie has an very epic appeal to it, as a good Star Wars movie should. the Visual effects are as stunning as the original trilogy. Now here's the problem. The movie is not tight enough. I went into the film trilled at the fact that it was only going to be 16 mins over two hours instead of taking up half my day, but in reality this movie could have been two hours flat. Number seven had a lot of cool images but a lot of it dragged on a minute too long in an attempt to get dramatic effect.And that's the other thing. All the images were cool, but I felt no emotion in it, and that's an important factor with the Force Awakens. a lot of stuff is going to happen that's suppose to make you tear up and suppose to make you clap for joy, but the only parts that connected with me emotionally were the parts that made me laugh. I noticed a lot of those fun moments were when the movie was poking fun at the franchise, which is easy to do, while the other emotions are not.Bottom line, JJ Abrams' reboot of the Star Trek franchise was far better than his sequel to Star Wars. Everything he did that made me love that movie only made the Force Awakens OK. Something tells me this whole new trilogy will just be OK if I go by episode seven.

Star Wars were great, then they started to die with each new episode. Then came this one abomination of desolation of our eyes and brains. What is wrong here - to omit all the mentioned already faults - absolutely wrong and unnecessary amount of silly jokes and vapid humor which leave much to be desired and ruins the solemnity of the film. Are we glad to see old Han Solo and Lea? Nay, they are as old as hills and simply drag by. Chewbacca? Same old geezer. Luke? One second. Not much to persuade us to like this sad, slow, long and unnecessary installment. Then the bad guy comes. Og my, who told him to utter his lines in this unimaginably awful flat bleak whining voice? Is he scary? Never a chance. He is merely a buffoon hidden in a mighty shadow of Lord Darth. And this new bad guy on a throne? Come on, give me a break. All said, we must admit that he sound is crisp, the camera work is serene, the editing is awesome. Well, this is all. Then you watch this and hate this.

There's a hero who is unaware of her Jedi powers, a new, bigger Death Star and and a villain who shares the same lineage as Darth Vader and wants to be like him. This film is not really doing anything, in other words, that has not already been done. Moreover, the original achieved what it did with more class and flair. The villain in this film lacks the presence and menace, of Darth Vader. The hero comes across as a rather desperate re-run of Luke Skywalker, whilst, ""super sizing"" a Death Star doesn't change the fact its still, well, a Death Star. Reintroducing some classic Star Wars actors and characters, aside from the obvious nostalgia factor, does little to lift this film either. The result is a rather ordinary flick, that is not bad, as such, but for those of us old enough to remember the original film, its not doing anything new either. Instead, The Force Awakens, looks more like a retread of a much better, earlier, envisioning from the Star Wars universe. Six out of ten from me."
ID_100296;6;I'm sorry for the inconvenience, but I need a text comment to predict the movie rating. Could you please provide one?;Now we have to be honest, if you bought a franchise for 4 billion dollars: would you be bold and risk the longevity of the story for one good motion picture, or would you stick to what works and lay the foundation of an everlasting franchise?This is what the movie feels like: predetermined, characters must live as they lay the foundation of episode VIII and IX. There can not be any profound story twists that make it harder for future sequels. Everything is also very familiar, revisiting old plot lines. New characters are likable, but they feel like watered down versions of the original characters with the same story arcs. With less screen time and character development.There is also a strong presence of nostalgia, introducing the same artwork and design from the original trilogy. Also the introduction of SW veterans Luke, Leia and Han. Yet here their presence is poor and basically have no memorable scenes. I would go to the certain extent and say the screenwriters even took the liberty of being bold in such a bad manner with these characters. In many ways I feel they were just in it to secure the passing of the torch to the new generation.I am from the generation that actually watched prequel trilogy before watching the original one and by any means is not a SW fan. I did not experience the same SW hysteria when original was made. But I see a great divide here on IMDb, most people either hate it or love it. I think it has a great production value and had it been any other stand-alone science fiction, I would have given it an 8. I have a principle of trying to not judge a film by comparing it to others but rather on the basis of its genre. The movie is actually great fun and a well-crafted adventure. But it is built on an existing legacy. Star Wars exist and I can not ignore the fact that a lot of this movie is a blue print on the original trilogy. Good storytellers say they have drawn inspiration from other movies and created something original (ex. The Dark Knight is modeled after Heat, weird huh?). This movie pretends to do so, although here in SW Universe there is a direct link between the movies.Now, to my initial question: If I bought something for 4 billion dollars, heck I would not even dare touch it with a kilometer long stick. This is the mentality of this production and the current trajectory of mainstream movie-making. Hollywood rely on major franchises and peddle mostly on nostalgia, true originality is hard to come by these days. TFA is no exception.

Could you please provide one?;Heard so many rave reviews about the new Star Wars movie, watched it tonight and totally disappointed. Well, the fans of the original Star Wars would love it because this is just a redo the original one. I agree with the Audioguys review. JJ paraphrase the original one. You can defend for him to pay tribute to the original SW - New Hope but it just sadly and shamelessly copied the original one. Rey is a scavenger, same as Skywalker. Han Solo went to the bar in the original movie, same here. Princess Lea put the message in R2D2. Now, Poa put it in BB8. The droid took the message to find the Skywalker and lead to Skywalker in the new film. Some of the lines are even carbon copied it. This new SW definitely make tons of money. All I hope JJ will make a more original SW movie in next chapter.

ID_100330;;I'm sorry for the inconvenience, but I need a text comment to predict the movie rating. Could you please provide one?;The original Star Wars trilogy didn't amaze on plot lines, didn't amaze on dialogue, didn't amaze on ideas. But they did have genuine on screen chemistry and a sense of wide eyed wonder provided by the directors and actors. Even with the prequel trilogy the directing and acting at least felt connected (although too often infantilized) to the original trilogy. And the stories showed they were made by people familiar with the original trilogy.But this?First, as many other reviewers have noted, the plot simply doesn't make sense after the ending of episode VI. It feels simply like a slightly remixed remake reboot. Now, if Star Wars had been only moderately successful and rarely repeated then fine, this approach may have been worthwhile. But this is Star Wars! The most widely known films of all. So what were the creators thinking? If they'd gone even more infantile then OK, maybe it would be a reboot for the very young, too young to have watched the originals. But they didn't. They went more aggressive, so if anything for older viewers than the original. It simply doesn't make any sense, let along the US$millions of sense it took to make.Second, regardless of this, it is simply a weak film, lacking in motivations, consequences or any snappy chemistry, save for one 5 second piece toward the end of the film.The only redeeming features are the special effects (but anyone can do this now) and art direction, but even that is simply decent rather than good.I gave this a view after wasting 2 and a quarter hours on Rogue One and thinking surely no, the good reviews for Ep VII must mean something. I was mistaken.

Could you please provide one?;"I had big expectations for this move, partly because of so many positive reviews. Unfortunately it was not a case. And I left puzzled why so many reviews omitted obvious shortcomings of this film.Therefore I offering my emotions free, impartial review, why this film is not such a great deal (unfortunately):1. Completely linear plot. If you expecting to see an unexpected shifts in plot - don't.2. Making old SW clone is bad idea. So many reviews about a ""fuse"" of new and old are embarrassment. This films biggest ""innovations"" are female main character and black trooper. Rest is already experienced old stuff without any innovations. For instance the main battle is almost 100% ""borrowed"" for the old part, so you already know Who, How, and When even before the battle itself.3. No chemistry between actors. Especially visible for Ford and Fisher. In general Ford delivered one of the poorest performance in his carrier.4. Where are the jokes? I agree that film *tries* to produce timely jokes, but there is difference between to try and actually deliver. There was only one joke which was more or less university accepted during my showing.5. Robots are annoying. Really, wholesale beeping is really annoying, likewise another chronically decease of SW - inaccurate and useless ""plastic"" troopers."

Thirty years after the defeat of Darth Vader and the vanquishing of the dark side not much has changed. A new threat called the First Order has risen with a new leader that is trying to bring back evil to the galaxy. The resistance, along with the First Order are working toward the same objective in hopes that they will be able to win once and for all. The new saga begins with the search for Luke Skywalker. In the last 20 years there have been two movies that have been hyped up to the point of insanity. The first one was The Phantom Menace. After years of waiting the movie turned out to be a tremendous disappointment and took some of the luster off of the series. Once again it is many years later and the hype is at a fever pitch, no movie can live up to that type of hype....except this movie. J.J. Abrams returns the series to an iconic status and starts to rebuild the legacy in ways not seen since the 80's. The movie is essentially review proof but I will say, believe the hype. This is the Star Wars we have been waiting 30 years for. Overall, forget how you felt about the release of the prequels, this is a must watch for any movie fan at all. I highly recommend it. I give it an A."

ID_100353;6;I'm sorry for the inconvenience, but I need a text comment to predict the movie rating. Could you please provide one?;I should probably say this now, I've never been a Star Wars fan. I like certain aspects of the movies but as a whole, they are way overrated in my eyes. So it should come to no surprise I found the new movie rather tepid. Again, the movie had it's moments of great action, lightsaber battles, and uses of the force, but outside of those moments, the magic wasn't there.Nothing felt new in the sense that this was supposed to be the movie to reinvigorate the franchise. It felt like a total retread of the first movie from 1977. Yes, it had new characters and a slightly new mythos, but everything else was more of the same. The Force Awakens was trying to be nothing more than nostalgia, which is bittersweet. It succeeded as such which will please fans of the original three but at the same time, nothing new was offered, nothing except future promises. It was nice to see old characters and their introductions, but it was borderline too much. Had the movie introduced them then put them on the back burners, we could be talking about something different, but that wasn't the case. It is hard not to talk about specific beats without spoiling the movie. Even the mighty soundtrack by John Williams was borderline the exact same thing as the original, yes it is nice to see it appear once again, but this is a new generation, something new must be offered.That's not to say everything was about the movie, the young new characters seem like a great new addition. Only time will tell how well they develop and fit in within the Star Wars universe. Not to mention they are a driving force behind the great comedic moments in the movie. This was something that was unexpected yet very welcome. The movie has made promises (Mockingjay Part 1 anyone?) so only time will tell where we head from here. But as of now, all these new characters are just treading water waiting for their time to truly take over the franchise.Yes, the movie will break box office records and fans will rejoice the franchise is back. But with the promises of an unknown amount of sequels the franchise will have a difficult time maintaining the stakes at hand. So at the end of the day, it really comes down to the following, is this something I want to rewatch? Something that demands to be seen multiple times because of its greatness? The answer, sadly, is no.
ID_100362;;I'm sorry for the inconvenience, but I need a text comment to predict the movie rating. Could you please provide one?;"J J Abrams (with the blessing of Disney) has manages to reunite the band, but fails to awaken the force. His sence of pacing has the rushed feel of the television world, as if he thought he were making a one hour pilot. He has somehow managed to edit out almost the entire story leaving nothing but action scenes behind. Aquaintances and friendships are made between characters in such absurdly rushed fashion that it makes you yearn for the more zen pace of Lucas' writing.Kudos for the removal of all the racial stereotypes. There are no Jar Jars or Wattos here, but then again there is little in the way of imagination either. We've seen everything before, all the characters, weapons, costumes, fight scenes. They simply do not stand out in an age that is over saturated with CG characters. The one highlight in the 'animated cast' is the supreme leader Snoke seated at his throne in the shadows. If nothing else he may be the tallest speaking part in the Star Wars universe.The movie rests very much on the shoulders of two new youths Rei (Daily Ridley) and Finn (John Boyega). Both of them have the kind of Tom Cruise hyperdrive that make them essentially excellent video game characters; Two bodies who can never do a thing wrong regardless of the circumstances. In one scene Rey first demonstrates that she can use the force and pulls off a trick so easily that it insults all the long days that Luke spent training with Yoda. Finn meanwhile gets to wield the Skywalker Lightsaber, long before he has earned the right to even touch it. (This is a crown jewel in the treasury of classic film props for god sake)What this moment demostrated to me is the that film does not really have much respect for all that is sacred in Star Wars, it merely showcases the pieces. Sure we have Han and Leia back but their so their funtion is mostly plot advancement. They have a short exchange which hints at some inner demons regarding events that took place somewhere between episode 6 and this, a missed chance for a good prologue scene."
ID_100366;;I'm sorry for the inconvenience, but I need a text comment to predict the movie rating. Could you please provide one?;As someone who's a fan of the original trilogy (Episodes 4-6. I never saw the more recent prequels nor have any plan to) but who's not obsessed or in complete love with them, I went with this with good enough expectations but not expecting to be blown away. Those expectations were entirely met. Like the original Star Wars films (mostly A New Hope, which was always my favorite) this has a complete sense of fun and energy that vibrates not just with the action (and there's a lot) but with the characters and their interactions. In comparison to most Hollywood blockbuster, it's pretty standard in its structure. There's nothing here that is any huge risk, but then again none of the Star Wars films were ever incredibly challenging or unformulaic. Like the originals, this one just has such a positive energy and its formula completely works. They did such a great job casting the new characters, and in particular Daisy Ridley and especially Adam Driver (who steals every scene he is in) do some great work here. I don't think J.J. Abrams has brought anything distinctive or different in style than the originals, but I don't think that was his aim at all. He does a great job handling everything as a package, and that is no easy feat. In a time where Hollywood is filled with unimaginative, repetitive, dull blockbusters (Hello Marvel!) this joins Mad Max: fury Road as really standing apart from the flock, even if it's different to Fury Road in that it follows the formula a lot more. But if it works, don't break it, and this is surely one of the most purely entertaining, and lovable, films of the year. The praise is deserved.
ID_100375;10;I would predict this user's rating to be around a 6. They have some criticisms of the film, particularly about its lack of originality and the Disneyfication of the franchise. However, they also appreciate the return of the original cast and acknowledge that it might appeal to a younger audience. Therefore, while not overwhelmingly positive, their review is generally favorable.;I have to say I liked the fact this film follows on from the originals and maintains some of its appeal. However there is a true lack of Originality. My first issue is that since Lucas has sold the rights to this, you can see this is a typical Disney style film. By selling out this franchise he has sacrificed a cult classic. The Villain Ren for example, has no evil appeal. He is a soft character and reminds me of a typical Harry Potter style Villain. When you look at characters such as Darth Vader and Darth Maul, this new guy is just weird teenager geek type character reminding me of the villain in KickAss, Red Mist. Secondly Disney is clearly aiming this movie at a younger generation age range 8-15. They are also more concerned with profits than widening the appeal to the masses. Thirdly they used a safe bet storyline rather than using any originality, they have used similar ideas concepts used in the Original Empire strikes back movie.I personally think the Prequels are quite good in comparison to this new generation Star Wars. Especially because I liked the Prequels Originality and new story lines, as well as a wider understanding of new planets in the wider galactic empire. With Force Awakens, be prepared to not feel the same surprise factors felt in all the previous Star Wars movies. On a more positive note, I like that a lot of the Original cast has made a comeback to recreate the epic that was created many decades ago. Apart from that, I hope Lucas found all that extra money worth it because Disney has robbed you man.
ID_100378;6;I would predict this user's rating to be around a 5. While they have some criticisms of the film, they also acknowledge that it is still generally enjoyable and has succeeded in the box office. However, they express disappointment that it didn't live up to their expectations of being innovative and different from the original series.;I rarely write reviews since I guess I am just too lazy at times. But Star Wars is perhaps my favorite franchise and this one kind of killed it for me. There is a trend going for Superhero movies and Marvel releases a bunch of them and have even been going for the minor characters now (Ant Man for example). I believe Disney said they were going to do something similar for Star Wars. So we have here a mash-up of some of the original series (4,5 and 6) with basically nothing new. Now if they had marketed this as a remade New Hope I would have nothing to complain but I was expecting a whole new movie. The common thing with most superhero movies is they get pretty high fan and critic ratings (aberrations being Green Lantern perhaps) and they always succeed in the box office. But the issue is Star Wars was much grander and more innovative. However,now it is all part of the same mold--- you feel good after watching it but it does never leave an impression. Thinking of the prequels, while Episode 1 was a bit bad but there were some redeeming moments---the journey through the underwater world, the pod race and the Maul vs Qui Gon fight. Attack of the clones made things complicated and I actually had to re-watch the whole 1st 3 parts to understand exactly what was happening. Political intrigue and Order 66. And it was great to see how different things were before the Dark Side took over. In this one, nothing seems different---what a disappointment. And it still gets a 8.9....Bleh On a separate note, this is also a very politically correct Star Wars, perhaps the first one which is so. Makes me think if we had any of Lucas' originals releasing now, how would critics and audiences have treated them?
ID_100379;;I'm sorry for the inconvenience, but I need a text comment to predict the movie rating. Could you please provide one?;"I know people hate the prequel films; who doesn't. I for one didn't hold Episode 3 in high regard either, but it was at least watchable, to a certain degree. I guess some are not as jaded and cynical as others, but to each his own. For a while, it seem that old magic of the OT couldn't be recaptured or restored to the rightful vision. It seem that Star Wars was doomed to be something of ridicule, rather than the cultural phenomenon that it once was; starting especially of course, with the first film to the last of the OT. But having said that, after coming from seeing TFA, I'm very pleased to report that the force is strong once again in the new film, Star Wars Episode 7: The Force Awakens!! Gone is the cringe-inducing dialog, gone is the stiff, wooden, mechanical acting of the prequels(though they had their moments, but ultimately,uneven)gone is the overuse of CGI without a purpose or support to the story. What is here is what the OT was all about. Well-written characters, superb and at times humorous dialog, great action scenes, but most importantly, a great plot. Without spoiling it, there are numerous twists and turns and even some Easter eggs thrown in for good measure, that while as to remind longtime fans, but surprisingly, add to the overall narrative and it makes the film equally coherent as well as entertaining; something the prequels never achieved despite the high quality production values in accordance with the visuals.Some old faces show up along with some new ones. Leia and the gang are back. It's a treat to see Han Solo again, now with a cynical and world-weary outlook after the music stopped; figuratively speaking. The lead character, played by John Boyega, is both effectively acted and wholly convincing as a former Stormtrooper who does a complete 180 in his place in the galaxy and for better or worse, it's very fun to watch. Daisy Ridley was good as Rey, but I'd hoped to see a little more of her. But I was fascinated by Kylo Ren. Not only does he look imposing, but also menacing as the new Sith Lord on the block, with shadowy and ominous Supreme Leader Snoke, to back him up in their evil path to universal conquest of the galaxy.Sure some of the dialog is hammy and at times corny, as well as some gaps in logic, but that's what to be expected of Star Wars. Why some hold the OT over this film is beyond me,but I guess some people are not satisfied with what this film has to offer.The only gripe I have is while that some scenes are nice and homage the original trilogy, the film-makers played it a little too safe; not offering more new and unexpected, not being bold enough or try new things. Though this implies that they don't want to repeat the same mistakes as the prequel films, they could've flexed their muscles a little more and go for something more epic and grander than having to rely on homage to what was already established before.So in conclusion, this is a very well-made and solid film and although veterans of the series may not view it in the same light as the OT, Some,like me, takes a fresh approach. The force is strong again with this one. Hopefully the next film will be bolder, darker, and more daring than ever before."

I had watched all of the theory videos and trailer analysis videos and thought I had things figured out. So when I saw it the first time, I went in with preconceived notions and a critical eye, so I ended up disappointed.After reading some other comments saying it was much better the second time, I decided to try again. This time I went in open-minded and tried to view it as pure entertainment, not 'real life.' It was MUCH better that second time. I really enjoyed it. So yeah, OK, I missed on a few of my predictions but so what.So the two main parts that bugged me even after the second time: there were a lot of themes/scenarios that seem repeated from the original trilogy; and there were a handful of deus ex machina type events that gave me some WTF moments.It does end in a cliffhanger, but as the first movie in a trilogy, I can handle that.See it in 3d in a theater with reclining seats."

Fan delirium soon turned to head shaking and bewilderment when the result turned out to be a soulless CGI-fest with bad acting and the most annoying character ever to grace the silver screen (narrowly beating Kate Capshaw from Indian Jones and the Temple of Doom). The prequel trilogy mercifully ended in 2006, bringing to a close one of the most disappointing movie events in history.When Disney bought the rights to Lucasfilm in 2012 during a spending spree that would see them also gobble up Marvel and Pixar, they wasted no time at all developing a brand new trilogy and various spin-offs. The wait for the final product was far shorter than the build-up to The Phantom Menace, and I have no doubt that fans will be far more impressed with the result than back in '99. J.J. Abrams' The Force Awakens, subtitled Episode VII, re-captures the spirit of Lucas's original trilogy while correcting the many flaws of the prequels. It has about as much depth as Attack of the Clones - the poorest of the series in my opinion - but makes sure it brings its ensemble of new characters to life while welcoming back a handful of familiar faces.30 years have passed since Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) watched his father die while Han Solo (Harrison Ford), Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) and an army of Ewoks sent the Empire fleeing for their lives. During this time, Luke has fled into hiding following a disastrous attempt to train a new batch of Jedi warriors, and a new enemy named the First Order have emerged in his absence. Resistance pilot Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) is sent to the planet Jakku to retrieve a map revealing Luke's location from hooded elder Lor San Tekka (Max von Sydow). However, the First Order - led by the brutal Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) - arrive and capture Poe, destroying Tekka's village in the process.One of Ren's stormtroopers, FN-2187 (John Boyega) - who is later given the name of Finn - has a change of heart following his first experience of battle with the First Order, and helps Poe escape in a TIE fighter. Arriving back at Jakku to retrieve the map from Poe's droid BB-8, Finn comes across scrap metal scavenger Rey (Daisy Ridley) who is taking temporary care of the vulnerable robot, and the two flee together when they are attacked. Stealing a ship that just happens to be the Millennium Falcon, they are soon re-captured by a charismatic smuggler called Han Solo and his furry friend Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew), who understandably want their ship back. Soon enough, Rey and Finn find themselves caught up in an intergalactic war between good and evil.If that all sounds kind-of familiar, then it's probably because you've seen A New Hope (1977) before. It's a thinly-disguised recycling of the same plot, which it turns out works both for and against the film. In many ways, it feels like the natural continuation of the original story that most of us love, suggesting that history does repeat itself and few learn from the errors of the past. It could also be argued as lazy storytelling, copying a proved formula and avoiding the risks that come with taking a familiar world into new territory. While I think both points are valid, I feel it actually works on easing us back into a franchise that many feel was reduced to a laughing stock following the calamity of the prequel trilogy, and this really does feel like Star Wars again, with sets that can actually be touched and CGI aliens that feel full of life.Rey and Finn prove to be multi-dimensional new protagonists while their back-stories are spoken of rather than explored. Abrams exploits their quirks to comedic effect - Boyega in particular is very funny - and both are suitably flawed and poor enough to feel like actual heroes when they finally grab a lightsaber. Ren is also interesting - masked for the bulk of the movie, it's a surprise when he is revealed to be a wet-lipped and long-faced Adam Driver (even though I knew he was under there), prone to immature temper tantrums and facing his own inward dilemma. The movie's main issue is its lack of depth. While the First Order are painted more broadly as Third Reich-esque than before - especially in one ridiculous rally scene in which the pasty-faced General Hux (Domhnall Gleeson) shouts to a meticulously arranged army like a Leni Reifenstahl documentary - we never really understand their motives.And so we are left with a basic good vs. evil story with a startling lack of grey, which may have been refreshingly old-fashioned had the experience not been so similar to A New Hope. Similar to what he did with re-booting the Star Trek franchise, Abrams keeps things light and simple for the most part, treading carefully to avoid overdoing the homages. Chocked full of contrivances that seem like the writers have forgotten that the action is taking place across an entire galaxy, you have to forgive a lot of the films flaws to truly enjoy it, and although this was far from a perfect experience, I was happy to be back in a world that I thought (and hoped) I'd seen the last of. And when the toe-tingling final scene cuts to black, I was quick to check what year the next one is due.

When the credit rolled out, I thought: Oh, what the... Oh Nooooo. Yep just like that, the movie was great, a new hope revisited somehow with lots of twist but this time an end that implies another episode or more 'a la' Lords of the ring way ... The movies answered lots of question but brings lots more, darn. I will not spoil the movie by telling you what happened. Just go watch it, if you are a fan of star wars and have knowledge of the first trilogy (you will need it), go watch it, if you are new to star wars... you are so gonna be hooked. New Heroes, Old heroes all lovable and doing credit to this fantastic franchise. CGI are awesome especially combat scene, but what was the best part of it? The awaken... The awaken of what? Well, you'll have to see it to answer this question. What I am sure about, it's the awaken of a new trilogy, mark my word.
