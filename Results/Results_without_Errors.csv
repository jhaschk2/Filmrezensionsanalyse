ID_100001;7;2;This film really is nothing more than an Advertisement. I'll admit the first time I saw it at the movies I thought it was pretty good, and i watched it another two times with friends and family over the course of a month before it finally left theatres. But after seeing it again, I realised something is off, something is not right about this movie. It's completely hollow with nothing beyond its visualsThe movie is well shot, I'll say that. It has great looking effects, but it's only there to hide the fact that once you look past all the superficial razzle dazzle to hide the mess underneath. The movie is nothing more than a shadow of the previous movies. Everything about it feels rushed. The characters are so aloof and seem almost brain dead. The dialogue is so shallow and paper thin, it's like the writers just gave up. The characters hardly develop or learn anything and Rey's transition to a Jedi is so fast and forced, you can see how how obvious that the writers were too lazy to even bother to give give her a proper arc and story and make her feel like an actual human we can care about. Because that would be too long and boring, wouldn't it... God forbid challenge people's short attention spans... Who even needs real developed characters... Nobody cares about that anymore... Just give them the razzle dazzle crap or whatever???It really is sad just how empty this movie is. The third time I watched it, it actually physically left a bad taste in my mouth, thank god for popcorn...
ID_100002;8;10;Star Wars: The Force Awakens Is a newest chapter in the long running Space opera saga, taking place 30 years after the events of Return of the Jedi. We learn from the opening text crawl that in the absence of Luke Skywalker, the sinister First Order has risen into power led by the menacing Kylo Ren(Adam Driver), who is on the hunt for the last Jedi Knight Luke Skywalker. He is introduced into the film in an explosive sequence setting the tone for the remainder of the film. Driver brings a lot of raw emotion to the part of Ren, who's being tormented by his feelings, and lure to the Light and Dark side. During the opening scene Ren comes into contact with newcomer Poe Dameron(Oscar Issac) a rebel fighter pilot regarded as the best in the resistance. Who is handed a vital piece of information, that could lead to the whereabouts of Luke Skywalker, and thus sets off a chain of events bringing in old and new characters alike. Issac brings a-lot of likability as Poe to the film, and was reminiscent of Han Solo(Harrison Ford) In the original trilogy. Whilst on the Planet of Jakku we're introduced to Finn(John Boyega) a disillusioned stormtrooper, who wants out of the First Order. Boyega plays the part with a lot enthusiasm, and joy he brings a lot of laughs to the story whilst maintaining his own dramatic moments through out the story. He eventually comes into contact with a scavenger named Rey(Daisy Ridley) on the planet Jakku. Who struggles to make a living finding scraps/relics for food, she is also torn between waiting for her family to come back, and realising that her journey is much more then salvaging parts, when She crosses paths with Finn and a lovable new droid named BB8. After a thrilling escape from the First Order our heroes come across veterans of the original series Han Solo(Ford) and the Wookie Chewbacca(Peter Mayhew). Ford does a good job of tying the mythos of the original trilogy, and connecting us with the newcomers, without ever leaving old viewers feeling cold and new viewers guessing as too what is happening.From the moment the film begins it maintains a breakneck pace, that hardly allows the viewer to stop and reflect what's happening with the plot of the film, which Is a good thing, because there are a-lot of plot holes In the film. We are also given enough information sprinkled throughout the film so that all the new characters feel fleshed out enough, to make us care about them.The film spends most of the first half on a desert planet named Jakku, The cinematography Is beautiful to look at, the screen Is filled with sweeping landscapes that gives the world a vast feeling of isolation and hopelessness. Disney brought In director JJ Abrams, who recently came off of rebooting the successful Star Trek franchise. He's the perfect choice to re-invigorate this franchise, his use of practical effects give this film a weight that all the prequels were sorely missing. We feel the size and scope of Starkiller Base, the heaviness of the Lightsabers, you feel the impact of the blaster rifles. The use of real locations and sets also give the film a-lot of natural colour which bursts onto the screen. Where-as the prequel trilogy which was all shot on digital, and Used a lot of CGI characters and effects. CGI in the film is used to a minimum and only used when needed. There were however a couple of characters, Unkar Plutt and Maz Kanata which felt like they could of been done better. In a couple scenes they look out place when surrounded by practical effects and actors in costumes and make up. Overall the film is visually stunning to look at because of this it gives the film(and series) a fresh vibrancy that has been lacking since Return of the Jedi. There are also just the right amount of callbacks, without it becoming crowd-pleasing, there is a plenty of nostalgia and references to the original films that fans of the series will recognise. John Williams also creates a new score with him that feels a little lacklustre when compared to original and prequel films. The only memorable theme being Kylo Rens.There were on the other hand certain aspects of the film which felt like it was treading old water from A New Hope, especially Starkiller Base, which is essentially a third Deathstar that feels like it's only part of the film so there's a third act, for all our heroes too band together and fight. It's hard not too notice certain similarities from the A New Hope, and at times feels like It's been done to play things safe after the backlash of the Prequels. The film is also filled a lot of humorous moments as-well, which helps to lighten up some of the darker aspects of the film, although not every joke hits the mark, and occasionally they feel out of place, especially during the the last act of the film.Star Wars the: The Force Awakens is filled with excellent set pieces which immerses the audience back into the universe. We're given enough plot information, and character development to draw us into the the new generation of characters. Whilst some areas feel familiar, there Is a lot too love about this film, watching this In the Cinema was an Incredibly exciting and engaging experience, which had me feeling like a kid watching the original films for the first time and being swept away into a galaxy far, far away. This film has resurrected the Star Wars franchise, and made it one of the must see film experiences of the year.
ID_100003;8;10;When I go to the movies, I aim to experience one thing: escapism. Even if it's for only two hours, I like to occasionally escape this often unfair world we all live in and lose myself in a fictional adventure. And I think I speak for both the young and the young at heart when I say that Star Wars has brought escapism to audiences all over the globe and for many generations over the past 40 years.I was born in the mid 1990s, so I never had a chance to experience the original Star Wars trilogy on the big screen and this was something that I had a hard time accepting ever since I was a child. I never thought I would be able to see Luke Skywalker, Han Solo or Princess Leia on the big screen ever in my life time. So you can imagine my excitement when I found out that they were making another Star Wars film that was not only inventing an entirely new cast of fresh faced characters, but was also bringing back the cast from the original films, who that of which have not walked on a Star Wars set for over 30 years. So it brings me great delight to be able to tell you that the most recent installment in the franchise did not disappoint.The new characters of the film are all fully developed and come with their own strengths and insecurities. They don't clash with the old cast, but instead melt beautifully with them in every scene. Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, Oscar Isaac and Adam Driver all do amazingly well. The old cast of course are all stellar too. They slipped back into their respected characters so seamlessly, it feels as though no time has passed at all.I was already familiar with J.J Abrams directing style going into this film. He, once again...does not fail to impress. This film is rife with stunning cinematography. The various locations are as gorgeous as they are aesthetically pleasing. CGI is used in this film, but to my relief it does not overpower the organic and practical effects. The environment in which these characters are staged in feels so authentic and believable, you feel as though you are a part of the journey yourself. It's instantly apparent that this film was made by a man who loves Star Wars just as much as we do.Overall, the film is a triumph. It's a wonderful collaboration of new and old filming techniques that combine beautifully to create the ultimate Star Wars film that everyone can enjoy. It doesn't matter if this is your first experience with the Star Wars saga, or if you've watched all of the films one hundred times over, fans both new and familiar will equally appreciate the love and care that was tirelessly thrown into this dazzling, epic adventure. I anxiously await the next installment.
ID_100004;8;10;If there's any movie you should see in theaters, The Force Awakens is it. From the first frame you're sucked right back into the Star Wars universe, and that's probably the best part of the movie - it feels genuinely like Star Wars. Not a child-pandering political farce (The Phantom Menace), a melodramatic soap opera (I'm looking at you Attack of the Clones) or a CGI filled sensory overload (Revenge of the Sith anyone?). No, it's barebones Star Wars. Visually stunning, constantly engaging, and most of all, it's incredibly fun. There are a lot of parallels with A New Hope, like how we're beginning this epic adventure with vastly different characters and learning their stories for the first time. And it shares the basic outline of that movie as well from the monumental opening shot to its massive riveting climax. It's a blast from beginning to end, and especially exhilarating in a packed IMAX theater. The characters are easily relatable from the moment they're shown. Their stories are simple and to the point, allowing the audience to follow them in their journey every step of the way. There's also a lot of humor in the movie, and not the dopey kind either. It's clever and self-referential humor that suits the characters and their motivations while also being damn funny in context.It's hard to put this into words because if you're a fan, you're well aware that watching Star Wars is an experience. There's a rush of being back in the universe and seeing some of your favorite characters again. The threats are even bigger this time around. The First Order is what the Empire has become, led by Supreme Leader Snoke and his apprentice Kylo Ren. At first glance Kylo might seem like a second-rate Vader, but he has much more depth than that. Things are revealed in the movie that piece everything together, and when all is said and done, Kylo Ren is not only a great villain but a great character - charismatic but insecure, arrogant but unexperienced. You can empathize with him at times, but it's obvious there's great darkness within him, and not only because of his haunting mask. The heroes Rey and Finn are immediately likable and easy to root for, and when they start uncovering the bigger picture behind the First Order's sinister plot, they behave exactly as you'd expect them to. Not pompous or valiant but hesitant and curious, at least until their lives are on the line and the only way for them to survive is to band together. Then their inner heroism comes to light.Everything about The Force Awakens is phenomenal - the acting, directing, and writing are all on point, and it serves as a wonderful template for this new Star Wars era. I don't need to spoil anything because the fact is, if you loved the original trilogy you're going to love this. Hell, if you're a fan of good cinema you should love this. Episode VII is what Star Wars fans have been yearning for, and when all is said and done, I couldn't ask for anything more.
ID_100005;9;10;"It's as if millions of Star Wars fans suddenly cried out in criticism and were suddenly silenced. That's the effect this movie *should* have on most (other than those who'd already decided they were going to be disappointed/hate it no matter what). For all the SANE Star Wars fans out there, I'm happy to report that the Force is strong with this series once again (after taking a walk on the Dark Side with the prequels). All other shoddy imitations take note: THIS is how you do a space opera. The Force Awakens possesses everything that was missing from the soulless prequels: we have a non-snooze-worthy storyline, likable new characters, great acting, non-cringe-worthy dialogue and not such a reliance on only CGI effects/green-screen. The pluses of this movie are in abundance, starting with what's new. All those with reservations about the fresh young actors cast to play new characters Rey and Finn should sit back, relax and watch the beautiful chemistry between the two as their characters form a believable friendship/dynamic on screen like that of the Original Trilogy's trio.Daisy Ridley more than proves she's up to the challenge of having a large portion of the new trilogy rest on her shoulders. Rey is a scavenger with a good heart (as evidenced by her rescuing BB-8, a droid carrying something important). Whilst certain people (who for some unfathomable reason don't like seeing a woman who can handle herself) may take this new female lead (who is smart, brave, kind and just all around awesome) as a personal affront to them, for the rest of us who *don't* hate seeing a woman take centre stage, this is what we've been looking for in a female character for so long. She's everything you could hope for, but not without her faults, as she does make some mistakes (but not enough to hate her for it). She's flawed, but much more interesting because of this. Ridley imbues her character with so much heart/soul, she conveys a lot with just looks and even proves adept at humour as well. Most importantly, she's *likable*, forming instant friendships with other characters who we already like (so we know she's awesome). Any gripes about her would be nitpicky/for petty reasons.Sharing Ridley's responsibility as one of the new faces of this trilogy is John Boyega as Finn, a former Stormtrooper who refuses to go along with the rest in doing something terrible. It's after this that he meets Oscar Isaac's Poe Dameron, who he forms an almost-immediate friendship with. Out of the three new leads, Isaac's Poe is probably given the least development, but he manages to make it believable that he and Finn become close friends in such a short time. The best dynamic, though, is without a doubt the one formed between Rey and Finn. The way they play off each other with such ease is, in large part, thanks to the actors, but also the dialogue being snappy/quick-witted. They share a fun friendship, becoming quite close, and the actors' enthusiasm/energy helps a lot, as they're truly inhabiting their roles/believing in who they're playing as well as the universe they're a part of (where characters talk/act in a unique way). One of many things the prequels sadly lacked was heart, but this movie/these characters have it in spades.Adam Driver's Kylo Ren picks up where Darth Vader left off as our main villain and is clearly devoted to his memory (since he talks to his burned mask). Driver is quite good at playing the bad guy, though he is prone to the occasional 'hissy fit' with his crossguard lightsaber which verges into slightly over-the-top/petulant teenager behavior. Thankfully, when the big moments occur, Driver shows real emotion/conflict within his character. His lightsaber duel, first with Finn and then Rey, is everything the over-choreographed prequel duels were lacking. They may've had the needless fancy twirling and whatnot, but here we have rough and tumble, gritty fights between someone skilled and two people who are only just learning what they're capable of. Plus there's real emotional investment, which helps. It's an epic tension-filled battle, which is a BIG plus with this movie, as we don't know what's going to happen.Naturally, it's good to see our old favourites back (Han, Chewie, Leia, R2-D2, C-3PO, even the Millennium Falcon, all of which received applause at my screening). Those claiming this film relies on nostalgia/good will towards the original films alone are mistaken. Whilst the prequels included familiar characters/moments just for the sake of callbacks, what they do here is much more satisfying. Han is his usual charming, funny, ""scruffy-looking nerf-herder"" self, but he forms attachments to our new characters, and his dynamics with them allows for some of the film's best moments. The movie certainly has humour, but thankfully it's not the ""cutsie"" nauseating variety found in the prequels. There are genuinely funny moments for young and old alike.J.J. Abrams has been unfairly criticised, when he should be receiving thanks. He had the unenviable task of reinvigorating/re-energising the franchise after the prequels nearly killed it and has managed to do so successfully. So what if there's some familiarity? My only quibbles were Domhnall Gleeson's shouty performance and Andy Serkis' CGI Supreme Leader Snoke. In most other instances, Abrams ensured that, along with story/character development, locations/miniatures/practical effects/make-up took precedence over a reliance on CGI/things that simply 'looked cool'. Some familiar musical themes appear on the score, but there are also some new ones which I appreciated were more restrained and not so 'in-your-face' as certain popular themes introduced in the prequels. There is also an abundance of excellent shots throughout the movie; quite a few are instantly iconic. It would be quite the feat for the following films to match this thrilling/exciting and enjoyable/satisfying first chapter of a new era in the saga. If nothing else, at least The Force Awakens easily beats The Phantom Menace in being a great start to a new trilogy of films."
ID_100006;6;6;"From the virtue signaling of social justice, to the cheap-jack plot-line which was easily discerned in advance, to the awful acting which evoked little but hooting from me, I was, as you can see, disappointed, and in some cases outraged. If you dare to join me, I will explain.I have nothing against diversifying the Star Wars universe, which is why I LOVED Star Wars 1, with its Oriental villains, Jamaican Gungan, Jewish scrap dealer, and more. It was a delight of indulgence which fleshed out characters of charm, making the experience vivid and interesting. But after Lucas received flak for ethnic portrayal, Jar-Jar became boring in Star Wars 2. In Star Wars 7, this pandering becomes intolerable. It's fine that Leah has the force, and it's fine that Rey inherited it, but Finn is gratuitous in his race. I would have nothing against this either but they make Finn formidable with a light-sabre against Kylo Ren. And please don't soft-soap me that love gave Finn the strength and skill to take on a pupil of the force - only hate has that power, the dark side. Otherwise, one must be cool and focused. Given this, I dismiss Finn and therefore it irritated me to watch Kylo Ren sword-play with Finn and not simply crush his windpipe with a wave of his hand, or penetrate his mind, which seems to be Ren's forte. As for Kylo vs. Rey, a bit more believable, but it made Kylo seem almost inept. Really? Rey's raw ability with zero training is tougher than Kylo with training? Not even close to believable.What didn't I like about the plot? Well, first, aren't we simply replaying Death Star destruction from the first trilogy? Why, yes we are. And it looks like the Supreme Leader made all the same engineering, logistic, and tactical errors as the Emperor, just on a grander scale, including the convenient ""having to recharge the cannon"" just long enough for the Resistance to ""win the day."" Yawn. Second, much of the plot was geared to exploit the Skywalker/Solo family tree, and there was no thrill to any of it. Darth Vader is Luke's father - WHOA! I jumped out of my seat. Han is Kylo's father? Zzzz. Even if you wanted to say this was a remake, which it's not, it doesn't have the pizazz, never mind the oomph, of the original. But what does? But the acting is where I think I really blew my cool. I can understand characters of convenience, and plot-lines of olde being rehashed, but it has to be acted well to pull it off. Even in Star Wars 3, as sappy as it was, the acting was GREAT, IMO. In Star Wars 7, Harrison Ford is just about limping to his finale, Carrie Fisher looks doddering and not commanding, Daisy Ridley grits her teeth so often I thought she was Red Sonja, John Boyega makes a concerted effort to appear naive at every turn (which makes his good fortune all the more unbearable), Adam Driver does not look torn in the least, and so forth.I can point to hundreds of interesting and thrilling moments from the first six episodes of Star Wars which makes a complete weekend binge-watch, over and over again. Star Wars 7 does not add to that excitement. The tech seems standard, the CGI a little too self-conscious, the nostalgic cheese forced, the push forward too bossy and not natural. Still, I give this film a 6 in the hopes that Star Wars 8 will push the envelope once again."
ID_100007;9;9;Loved the original 'Star Wars' films as a kid, still do. Especially 'Empire Strikes Back' while considering 'A New Hope' a genre landmark. Didn't think the prequel films were that bad personally, but they had a lot wrong with them and were a long way from great, especially 'Attack of the Clones'.Despite seeing 'Star Wars: Episode VII- The Force Awakens' around the time it first came out (maybe a little after), there was a long time of being put off by the vitriolic hate it's gotten here and the practical war zone there is in order to review it (even when it was critically acclaimed). Finally mustering the courage, count me in as somebody who loved 'Star Wars: Episode VII- The Force Awakens'. A masterpiece? No. Better than the prequels? Absolutely, and although some may disagree this is saying a lot. The best 'Star Wars' film since 'The Return of the Jedi?' Yes.'Star Wars: Episode VII- The Force Awakens' is not the most original plot-wise. It has been criticised for being a re-hash of 'A New Hope', understandably. However, instead of being done in a cheap and slap-in-the-face way, it felt like an affectionate and nostalgic homage. Exemplified by bringing back major characters from the original trilogy in supporting roles. JJ Abrams, and this may be considered blasphemy, does a much better job here than he did with his 'Star Trek' reboot films, here he keeps the original spirit of the original trilogy intact while giving the film its own identity at the same time.While it certainly dazzles in spectacle and action, 'Star Wars: Episode VII- The Force Awakens' doesn't feel too big, too noisy or too chaotic at the expense of creating memorable characters, a fun story and brains and heart. The characters are memorable with easily identifiable leads, the original trilogy characters bringing a lot of affectionate nostalgia and a well executed if not iconic (not by Darth Vader standards anyhow) villain in Kylo Ren (unpredictable and dangerous but feeling he is morally justified).The story lacks originality but more than makes up for it in energy, non-stop heart-thumping thrills and excitement, generosity, a cheerfulness that is positively space operatic, vibrant charm and a few fresh twists along the way. In many ways it is a celebration of the universe while also an expansion of it. It is sometimes sentimental but never overly so, one crucial death scene is just heart-wrenching (particularly Chewbacca's reaction) and doesn't feel like a slap in the face to the character in question.Could the villains have been better written? Ren is fine but Snoke only just about works as a character thanks to the visual effects and especially the powerfully enigmatic with a touch of vulnerability performance of Andy Serkis, other than that the character is underwritten. Also felt that Gwendoline Christie's character was unnecessary, so limited was her screen time.Visually, 'Star Wars: Episode VII- The Force Awakens' is a triumph. It is gorgeously shot and designed with Abrams' visual storytelling shining far more here than it has in other films he's done. The special effects are a dazzling marvel. John Williams delivers yet another rousing score that has its own character but cleverly includes the well-known iconic themes from the previous films. Thank goodness that the dialogue contains little to none of the cheesiness heard in the prequels, and it even has more layers than that of the original trilogy.Acting also shines, with winning charismatic performances from John Boyega and particularly Daisy Ridley. Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher still have it, while Max Von Sydow shows himself to be a master of gestures and eye contact speaking louder than words. Adam Driver is a suitably menacing Ren and Serkis makes much of his somewhat underwritten character. Oscar Isaac gives a typically strong performance.In conclusion, a great film, the best 'Star Wars' film since 'The Return of the Jedi' and one of the best of the saga too. 9/10 Bethany Cox
ID_100008;9;9;"Star Wars: The Force Awakens steps into a big boots and fills them honorably. The Force Awakens look, feels and sounds like the real Star Wars movie. It contains all the elements that made the original story so epic. It tells an epic story with great scenery and with fine action and adventure. The Force Awakens is like a reboot of an original story, but the same time it is clearly continuation to an original saga. The story and characters are written well. Actors and actresses get through greatly at their roles. No one feels lame or factitious. The story is clearly a tribute to Han Solo, but at the same time it brings new characters well present. Maybe only one thing is not perfect. The story serves background stories of some characters almost too easily and dish out them with no big surprise which made the original movie so epic. The original story was actually a soap opera of one family. There are some elements in this story too, but they are reveled almost too easily. Greatly the story leaves enough of loose ends, so probably we will get bigger surprises of the characters later at upcoming movies.Star Wars: The Force Awakens is loyal to its fans and it lacks of prequels plastic look. It looks familiar, but at a same time it is fresh and interesting. Iconic characters are brought back honorably, but at a same time it tells a new story with new characters. It offer a nostalgic and new epic adventure at same package. Great script offers enough of action and adventure. It almost feels like George Lucas says: ""This is what the Star Wars meant to be"".J.J. Abrams manages to refresh Star Wars saga to present day without forgetting the original fans. It almost feels like I was again that 12 year old boy at 1977, who watched the original story 13 times in two weeks.I watched this movie first time in 2D, but I will watch it again and next time I will see it at 3D, so I will add later to this review how 3D worked in this movie."
ID_100009;5;5;"In essence a remake of 'A New Hope' as opposed to a proper sequel, the check-box resemblance this long-awaited revival shares to its franchise's debut is genuinely uncanny and sadly staggering since this was the perfect opportunity to try something new considering that the 'Star Wars' moniker is a powerful enough box-office draw to recoup any budget, apparently no matter how exorbitant, and withstand more than a few bad apples (*cough* the prequels *cough*). What's here in 'Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens (2015)' is based on nothing more than nostalgia, a series of slightly sickening ""remember this thing""'s and ""this guy still looks the same but he's grey now""'s that become incredibly tiresome increasingly quickly. If you take away the franchise underlayer you're just left with a hollow, characterless piece that gives you no reason to care and very little actual information despite all its endless exposition. In the end, I was honestly bored even during all of its high-flying fanfare. 5/10"
ID_100010;10;10;"How do you please franchise fans old and new while making a good, impactful and memorable movie? Do exactly what JJ Abrams did here, to a tee. My friends, real fans who grew up with the original trilogy and watched this one with me, expressed a physically relief of feeling there was very little to complain about and that ""'they' didn't mess it up"", but my feeling was even more positive. They exceeded my high expectations, brought me into a mysterious and magical voyage and left me wanting more until the last frame. A real cinematic experience.Star Wars formula could be deemed to appeal to simplicity (like good vs evil) with a few twists. Fun fact and contingent to the same doctrine, the majority of its meaningful characters name limit themselves to 3 or 4 letters: Han, Luke, Leia, Yoda and now Rey, Poe and Finn. If not letters, we can substitute numbers: R2D2, C3PO or BB8.Well, we can now focus on 2 letters: JJ. JJ Abrams directs and co-writes this brilliant installment in the multi-billion dollar franchise which set ridiculous revenues after a record-breaking first day (not counting merchandise and video sales)It also comes with extremely favourable critics and has started an epic new trilogy as well as spin-offs we all hope will continue to remain a high level of quality such as Rogue One already did incredibly. But back to this highly anticipated sequel which manages to create nostalgic moments with its characters, settings and story. Every Star Wars Fans will enjoy the scenery of a defunct Star Destroyer in the desert, but overall cinematography and scenery is in fact the best of all the Star Wars by its beauty and diversity. We get sultry desert in Jakku like Tatooine and forest like Endor. We get beautiful snow that surpass Hoth, buildings and water like Naboo and idyllic Irish-like islands. Daniel Mindel is the cinematographer who also did marvels with JJ on the first 2 Star Trek reboots. Every battle scene is sweeping and spectacular with many elements, motion and emotion. Humour is effective and tension is well crafted and augmented by sound, music and editing.Here Abrams outdoes himself by keeping it crisp with new likable and believable characters, great acting and superb directing to keep everything flowing and fans following. We feel for the characters, old and new. We are intrigued and we do not want it to end. A pretty much perfect movie of the genre and for a new generation, with Rey a particular stand-out.Han and Leia were not only there for older fans, but make it work as very important elements to the story. The writing and directing for them is just right, like the rest of the movie. Award-worthy, action-packed, well-paced, high expectations delivered and then some.It's decisively the best Star Wars yet, and that is no small feat. One small step for a fan, but a giant leap for longevity and quality!Rian Johnson has some SERIOUS shoes to fill for Episode 8.10/10"
ID_100011;9;10;The opening of Star Wars, The Force Awakens, with the titles traveling along the screen, and the orchestra following in the background, immediately absorbed me into the experience. Although I initially feared this sequel would fall flat, from the very beginning, the film sends its audience on a magnificent ride across the galaxy. There are significant gaps in the story-line, from the conclusion of the last installment up until this point in time, some of which are addressed over the film's duration, while others will hopefully be answered in future episodes. Despite some segments of the film bearing a striking resemblance to scenes encountered in previous installments, these are so well delivered, they offer the viewer moments of nostalgia, that have not been felt, since the original trilogy, all those years ago.Acting heavy-weights, like Harrison Ford in his return as Han Solo, Carrie Fisher as General Leia Organa and Mark Hamill as Luke Skywalker, help revitalize the franchise, though their screen time is minimal in contrast with the new faces. Ford offers both a melancholic and nostalgic performance, that lends emotion to his scenes, as a former war hero turned smuggler, while his take charge attitude, and banter with Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew), remains as entertaining as ever. Max Von Sydow additionally has a cameo role, of significant import, though again, deserved more time on screen.Rey (Daisey Ridley) is a scavenger on the desert planet of Jakku, who scroungers desperately to survive, while awaiting the return of her lost family. When she encounters a droid, BB-8, she has no idea of the adventure, not to mention the danger, she has inadvertently put herself in. Holding information vital to both the Resistance, the protagonists in the film, and the First Order, the villainous group that has taken over from the Galactic Empire, it seems almost everyone in the galaxy is seeking its retrieval. Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), a Sith with an interestingly poignant past, is one such character who pursues the droid, in the hopes of capturing the information contained within.Driver, most known for his comedic roles, is especially great, being as villainous as he is sentimental, brilliantly demonstrating a man with no control over his emotions. In contrast, fellow villains, including General Hux (Domhnall Gleeson), and Captain Phasma (Gwendoline Christie), don't appear as frequently, nor receive as much depth, which is unfortunate, considering how interesting their characters are.When Rey encounters Finn (John Boyega), a storm trooper, who despises the violent actions of the First Order, they are forced to make a series of difficult choices, that will lead them on a journey across the universe. Boyega and Ridley are equally terrific in their roles, and are great characters for the audience to follow, demonstrating acts of heroism and courage throughout the film.Furthermore, landscapes across the universe depict planets that have continued on after the war with the Galactic Empire, the remnants of fallen behemoths dotting the horizons. The vehicles and weaponry that are utilized, remind audiences of episodes four thought to six, and the moment the light sabre makes its appearance, I doubt a single person will be able to contain their excitement.The soundtrack is very much reminiscent of the franchise, and legitimizes the experience. The special effects are incredible, from battles in outer space, to fights on the ground, lasers and explosions littering the battlefield of the frequent, and fast paced, action scenes. Though Episodes Seven is basically one action scene after the next, the script provides enough emotional depth and characterization between these scenes, to keep audiences invested. Not only this, humor is well incorporated, the banter between characters, alongside the one-liners, bringing a series of laughs, beside the frenetic explosions.To view the film in 3D offers the viewer significant depth, though moments when characters, props, or the general setting, jump out at the audience, are quite minimal. When this does occur, often it is from the left, or the right of the screen, rather than from the very center, making the effect less impressive. If you were hoping to feel as though you might get hit at any moment by an incoming laser, sadly, that will not transpire here.Though a couple of moments during the plot are predictable, Star Wars Episode Seven is a brilliant return to a franchise that was originally only meant to house six episodes. If this new installment is what we ought to expect from the upcoming films, then the Star Wars universe is looking very bright indeed.
ID_100012;10;9;"I will try to keep this as spoiler free as possible, but if you still haven't seen it: stop reading about it, and go see it.In The Force Awakens, as with other reboots and sequels of old franchises, it's a challenge to balance the old with the new. The two previous trilogies were both of their time, and different in many ways. This new one will also need to be of its time, and different from the other ones. Story wise, it's obviously more connected to the original trilogy. In addition to this, the structure of the movie itself is very much based on the older trilogy. Much of the movie acts like a parallel to episode IV, while at the same time feeling different enough to not be considered a remake or rehash of the same ideas.As in other sequels, the original cast - now old and weary - is back in this one. Without going into spoilers, I will say that they all did a superb job acting wise, and I liked the way their stories has progressed. What's more interesting, though, is that is the new characters you end up feeling most excited about. It's great to see the old cast, and they are very much involved in the plot, with important parts in regards to action and plot. But still, it's the new characters you come out of the cinema thinking about, and look forward to seeing again. Especially Kylo Ren was interesting. I like how they portrayed the conflict between the light and dark side of the force, it's much more believable than it feels in the other movies (especailly the prequel trilogy).The movie is much more busy than the previous films. I think that's natural in today's cinema environment, and that it works well. Watching it, the story just kept on giving, and there was great, fantastic scenes throughout. I wasn't bored for a second. I can see this disappointing some fans - but as mentioned before, I think that Star Wars movies should be of their time. The special effects were fantastic as well. The practical effects, like costumes and so, worked brilliantly in conjunction with the newer stuff. The few CGI/Mo-cap-characters that had big roles were maybe the weakest point SFX-wise, but they were by no means eyesores.The movie ends in a way that to me was satisfying. It's obviously the first part of a longer story, and there's many more questions to be answered. Some less significant questions I assume will not be answered in the big movies, but rather TV-shows or other media. The big questions will obviously come back in the later movies. Especially regarding the back story of certain new characters, and the whole situation in the galaxy. (On that note: I liked the opening crawl. Informative and to the point. Neiter the crawl nor the rest of the movie is too heavily focused on ""what happened in-between"" VI and VII.) A last note: I've seen people complain (and worry) about too much fan service. As a fan, I am mostly very happy with the choices they made.Take this review with a pinch of salt. I was very much a part of the hype leading up to this movie, and I might have other thoughts after a re-watch or two."
ID_100013;6;3;"Ever since I was a kid, I loved this franchise. Even episode 1, by far the worst in the series, had that ""star-wars feel"". Mostly thanks to great casting of Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor, awesome new dark side character and dual light saber. So despite extremely high expectations, the series wasn't ruined and effectively picked up in dark episode 3. Then Disney followed up with this one, with J.J.Abrams at helm, which once again rose the expectations. Well it's not good. Especially the casting and acting of younger stars. Even Harrison Ford and Chewy can't save this mess. It may be a blasphemy, but unfortunately Ford can't pull off ' ""the cool"". Sorry guys, he's a bit too old, so some action scenes look out of place. The casting of young stars was atrocious. Simply bad. Bad chemistry, Bad looks (ecpecially the Kylo Ren character), badly choreographed fights, Bad everything. On top of which, Abrams took the period as a remake of original which should not be touched! At all. Due to stunning (as expected) visuals, and a personal love to the universe, this movie can be watched, but if this awful trend continues, even special effects and millions of fans won't be able to save the series."
ID_100014;10;10;A fantastic addition to the Star Wars series!Great story, excellent acting, brilliant action, and so on.The photography was sweeping and excellent. The characters were imaginative and fresh. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and would watch it again without hesitation.The plot was easily the best of the entire series and the cast were all outstanding in their parts.I truly look forward to the next installment and hope J. J. is at the helm. (Scratch that, he actually is!!!!)
ID_100015;9;10;This movie is the perfect way to introduce Star Wars to a generation that was almost plagued with nothing but those god awful prequels.The characters are likable, the story is similar but with a fresh new take, and it pays homage to the original trilogy by mixing in ideas from the first three movies and combining them into this visual masterpiece. Personally, there is only one problem I have with this movie, the rathar chase. But even that I didn't have too much of a problem with.Overall Star Wars: The Force Awakens is one of the best if not the best movie released in 2015, here's hoping The Last Jedi continues this trend
ID_100016;10;10;I saw this movie with my wife and I have to say this was even better than I ever thought possible!All these people that want to compare this to episode 4 are just the type of people I am sure that just can't be pleased no matter what you do for them. Wake up spammers with boring lives, This is STAR WARS driven by the best part of the force. I consider this a continuation of brilliance at its finest. You people that endlessly cry about this movie did actually see it, right? LOL Can't wait to see this story continue for years to come. This has made me an even bigger fan of Star Wars. I thought the acting was top notch, especially Harrison Ford, he stepped right back into that role perfectly.Enjoy an amazing movie for exactly what it is.........AMAZING!
ID_100017;10;10;This film is great! I have seen this movie 5 times and it never got old. In my opinion it got better!! It has a great heroin in rey and villain in Kylo and great action scenes and emotional scenes! Is Star Wars at its best the second best star wars movie out there! Go see it on a big screen with the volume turned all the way up!:)
ID_100018;9;9;There are very few people who won't admit this is the most anticipated movie of this decade. Taking all those expectations into account reviewing this title is quite a difficult and delicate thing but after seeing this movie on its release day it is impossible to hide all these positive emotions. Every fan will rediscover his inner child and get goosebumps at almost every reference to the galaxy far away.J.J. Abrams is one of the most acclaimed directors of his generation and putting him at the helm of this project was undoubtedly right decision. The way he handles this ultra-heavyweight burden of expectations and historical importance is just jaw-dropping. Throughout 135 minutes of the movie your mind travels through flurry of his impeccably executed ideas. Perhaps the best thing about this movie is that it still feels fresh despite (expectedly,I must admit) putting so many references to the previous installments. Those references are also the reason I didn't give 10 stars. Sometimes you get the feeling that it is all about refreshing all the stuff from 70s and 80s. Most likely that is the result of big corporation (Disney) standing behind high grossing project as Star Wars really are. But don't worry about that too soon because flaws are easily overshadowed by a decent plot and cinematography at its very highest.Cast consists of both rising stars and franchise veterans. And this combination never fails to amaze because the chemistry between characters is just like in the old days of Star Wars when Harrison Ford and co. were not that famous. Boyega and Ridley give their best and really live for this movie and their ambition about this project is almost palpable. Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) may feel like Darth Vader 2.0 but he is somehow more intriguing. Queen Leia and Han Solo are just as good as ever and having them back here is a real joy. Luke,well his story is more of a mystery,that's all I can say.Whatever your attitude towards this one is,if you ever liked any of the six previous parts you should go for this one. Despite sometimes feeling a bit too familiar and serial it is more than welcome arrival in this franchise. Whole crew just put their hearts into this one and created a magnetic atmosphere that really makes this one of the most enjoyable movies of 2010s so far. I wouldn't dare to say it is the best of 2015 but it is definitely up there among the best.
ID_100019;6;3;Why another less than superlative review? It's the movies I guess - or Hollywood. There is a good one planned shortly to make up - I promise.Long before this film arrived I claimed you couldn't do Star Wars over. This Disney remake has proved me right. It leaves me wondering if walking away from Lucas was a good thing to do. It's true he overreached himself with the prequels and botched the whole thing. But they could have done better with a proper director and screenwriter. Lucas had the vision, there's no doubt about that.Back to this film: I'm scratching my head. On the one hand it feels like a total remake of the first film with a few corny exceptions.After the last scene, I had to wonder if maybe there WAS a story sweep coming out of all this rehashed mess. Something original perhaps. That would be nice.That's the reason I advise Disney to never do this again. If they want to utilize Star Wars in their theme parks, well that's fine. Just don't ruin a classic syfy saga to do it.
ID_100020;6;6;"A fairly long time ago, in a county not so far away (Elstree Studios are an hour's drive away from yours truly), a great adventure took place. Now, J.J. Abrams, in league with the 'House of Mouse', has returned to make a seventh chapter in the franchise, and it's almost identical in plot to the first film, but with only a fraction of the magic and charm.Daisy Ridley plays Luke sorry, I mean Rey a scavenger on the desert planet of Tatooinesorry, I mean Jakku who becomes involved in the rebellion against The Empire sorry I mean The First Order after she bumps into R2D2 sorry, I mean BB-8, a droid carrying plans to the death star sorry, I mean to the whereabouts of Luke Skywalker. Meanwhile, the First Order are preparing their new weapon, the Death Star sorry, I mean Starkiller Base for use against the rebellion, who are forced to launch a risky counter-attack that sees Rey coming face-to-face with masked villain Darth Vadersorry, I mean Kylo Ren (Adam Driver).I've learnt to keep my expectations low for Star Wars films since The Phantom Menace, so I can't say The Force Awakens was a massive disappointment; it is what I feared it would be—a rather safe reboot, lacking in fresh ideas, which aims to please younger viewers with flashy visuals, whilst pandering to the older generation by including sly nods to the original trilogy. Personally, I would much rather they had taken a bolder approach: let's be honest they couldn't have got it any more wrong than the prequels.There's a spark of originality in the form of Finn (John Boyega), a stormtrooper who has a change of heart and joins the rebellion, the production design and effects are incredible, and I admit that the return of Han Solo and Chewbacca warmed even my cynical heart, but on the whole I was left wanting by this latest instalment, particularly the final assault on the Starkiller Base, which was completely bereft of tension. In fact, my favourite moment of the whole film is when Carrie Fisher tries to convey anguish, but her plastic surgery doesn't let her."
ID_100021;1;1;Oh how I miss the style of that awful film called 'The Phantom Menace'.This film has no style. It looks like a joke. Like fan fiction with a big budget. Like a Christmas Special Star Wars reunion on the set of Spaceballs and with villains from Harry Potter or Dr Who. I just don't know what to say. I won't even review the plot (which is a total rip-off of the 1977 Star wars), the acting or the direction. This is a joke. Unwatchable garbage. You know which character I liked? That little robot that follows them around. That's it. The rest are useless.And no, I do not appreciate even more of that 'girl power' nonsense that is still being shoved down our throats. I give these 'Star Wars' zero stars.
ID_100022;10;10;"My expectations were very, very high for this movie.Starting with the opening scene, a typical Star Wars opening, I wondered how well it was done. I wondered how it would be different and yet new, rebooting some of the old and original without seeming stagnant.JJ delivered on the Star Trek reboot and he absolutely nailed this one as well.He made it his own movie, he engaged original characters by engaging the new and the old. He let the characters tell their own stories without pushing over the boundaries. The story flowed.John Williams does it again. Harrison Ford was spectacular. The newcomers were fun, engaging and ""cheer"" worthy.My only complaint is this: do I really have to wait 2 more years to see the next amazing one directed by Abrams?!Someone pass me the Xanax while I wait, please!!!"
ID_100023;6;6;If you were expecting something different and better, you will be disappointed with SW7, Force Awakens.The plot seems pretty similar to the previous plots. This young girl Rey seems to have something special. Could she have special Jedi powers? Who is this guy Finn and why did he leave the troopers? It was comfortable to see Chewie and Hans Solo, like putting on a nice comfortable, well- work jacket. But there are chase scenes, and a bad guy who is eerily similar to Darth Vader, with again the father/son angle thrown in. Fighter jets attack a big bad warship. The computer robot has a special role. Does this all sound familiar? Oh, and at the end you are left hanging, knowing that the franchise will continue. Same old same old.Star Wars 7 was nothing special, except the hype, and seeing Harrison Ford again. Otherwise, I think this bridge to the next generation of SW fans might just be a bridge too far. Stick with the Star Trek movies - they are more enjoyable that this retread.
ID_100024;10;10;Ten out of Ten against the negative whiny fan-boys. This movie is really amazing, and MOST of the world LOVE this film. Box office!!!It is a fun Star Wars ride in every way. It COULD have been worse, but JJ did an amazing job pulling this off. Felt like Star Wars all the way. No one complained in the first few weeks, and then... let the haters go home and leave the rest of the world enjoying this movie Finn and Rey all the way!!!!
ID_100025;6;6;Was the movie entertaining? Yes, moderately..Did it blow me away? Nope..It is like any other superhero movie(exception: christopher nolan's batman reboot), only this time it happens to be with star wars background, where the lead character does everything ..visuals were good..and music was good in parts..dialogue just OK..There is no depth to any character, neither any intensity in the plot nor gripping narration...it was just beeeeeeeep from start to end..but thats enough to become huge success these days i guess..sad state of Hollywood movies....
ID_100026;10;9;This movie was fun. From beginning to end, it was a good way to jump start the star wars franchise. While I'm not a JJ Abrams fan at all, and can't stand his Star Trek movies, I also don't like his habit of let's do it because it's cool and never explain a thing, this was a fun movie. The new characters are tremendous and the only complaint I have is that it really brought out the worst in Star Wars fans. There's no such thing as black stormtroopers! How the hell does anyone know that? (I would have liked to know why they stopped using clones). Why a female jedi hero? Why the hell not? Just sit back and enjoy the movie or shut up.
ID_100027;6;3;SPOILER ALERT: Plot points discussed Entertaining as a stand alone movie, but a huge disappointment for a remakequel. The purpose of this film is to sell toys and to sever all connections with the previous six movies and make it Disney Wars.If you've seen the original, then you've already seen every scene in this one. What was JJ thinking. A forced along plot full of illogical actions. Disney and JJ ripped the fans off big time by just remaking the first one, only with an extra touch of stupidity.JJ took a red lightsaber and shoved up the fans @$! The force was not strong with this one. you can expect the next to films to eliminate all the Lucas Characters - chewy, R2, C3, Luke, Lea, and even admiral Ackbar.
ID_100028;10;10;Don't let the shrill minority fool you, Star Wars The Force Awakens is one of the greatest films ever set in a galaxy far, far away. J.J. Abrams and Lawrence Kasdan have accomplished what I thought to be impossible: they have resurrected the Star Wars franchise with more life and vigor than ever. From a beautiful story to crackling dialogue that doesn't take itself overly serious, this film is brimming with everything we ever loved about Star Wars. The acting is better than we've ever seen it, with our returning cast, specifically Harrison Ford churning out their best performances yet. My favorite part of the film, however, are the new players. All of the young cast, specifically Adam Driver and Daisy Ridley stun in their respective roles. This film plays as a love letter to fans, and while it's impossible to please everyone in the internet age, as a man who loved the original trilogy long before the prequels, I can assure you that if you consider yourself a real Star Wars fan, you will fall in love with this film. I implore you to see it multiple times. It's gotten better every single time. It's now tied with Empire as my favorite Star Wars film. This film will stand the test of time for generations to come. Thank you J.J. and Kasdan for this gem of a trilogy kickoff!
ID_100029;10;10;"Star Wars The Force Awakens is a beautiful film. It's the Star Wars film that we've been waiting for for 30 years, the film that the prequels failed to deliver. It is full of gorgeous visuals, memorable characters, and genuinely funny lines but above all, it truly felt like how a Star Wars movie should feel. Wildly entertaining, at no point during the film did I feel removed from the action, or that I was waiting for the next scene to happen. The movie is very fast paced, with very few slow moments. That being said, the action flows together perfectly and somehow manages to never feel rushed. For me, by far the best part of The Force Awakens were the characters. And I don't mean Han, Luke, and Leia. While it was great to see the original three back in action, and Harrison Ford gave another brilliant performance as Han Solo, the ones that really stole the show were the new characters. The story centers around Rey, an independent, resourceful scavenger on the planet Jakku. Rey has clearly endured many hardships throughout her life and yet somehow, she remains hopeful about her future and maintains a strong optimistic attitude. As the movie progresses, we see Rey begin to discover her powers with the force and how to use them. But only towards the end of the film do we realize how powerful she truly is, and I am very excited to see what's in store for her in episodes 8 and 9. Part of what made Rey such a believable, effective character was the spectacular acting performance by Daisy Ridley. No other actor could have done a better job. The majority of the comic relief in this film comes from Finn, an ex storm trooper who encounters Rey in the desert after he crashes while trying to escape the First Order. It was fascinating to see a little inside the life of a storm trooper, something we never really saw in any of the previous films. Finn is equally as believable a character as Rey, and John Boyega's performance was spot on as well. Part of what made these two characters so great was the on screen chemistry between them, something that the prequels failed to deliver with Anakin and Padme.As for Kylo Ren, aka Ben Solo, it was awesome to see such a complex character that has so many layers as the villain. We learn more about Kylo Ren's back story and personality in this one film than we do about Darth Vader in almost all of the original trilogy. The light saber temper tantrums, the side punching, the conversations with Darth Vader's helmet, Kylo Ren is the perfect balance of emotional kid and pure bad-ass. Star Wars The Force Awakens has brought back everything that I loved about the original Star Wars while at the same time, adding an element of mystery that did not exist in the originals. The movie is pure fun to watch and is so entertaining that I didn't notice any of the issues until my second viewing. If a massive grin didn't spread across your face when Han and Chewy burst through the doors of the millennium falcon, or if you didn't get goosebumps when Finn ignited Anakin's light saber for the first time, then you were never a TRUE Star Wars fan to begin with.Facts and even more facts. You're welcome ; )"
ID_100030;10;10;"I was absolutely sure this was going to be an epic failure after the horrible taste the prequels left us with. I watched the prequels before watching the movie. They were even worse than I remembered them. Atrocious. Unwatchable. The best thing that could ever happen was Disney getting Lucasfilm off George Lucas' hands. George Lucas, thank you for not being involved AT ALL in this movie. You almost destroyed Star Wars with the ""prequels"".But JJ Abrams and Disney... they created a masterpiece. This is movie is so stunning on so many levels I can only compare it to when I was 3 years old and watched Star Wars in a huge movie theater. Goosebumps, chills, the whole deal. This movie feels real, looks real, just like the original trilogy did. This is amazing - I couldn't imagine Disney topping the original trilogy - but in my humble opinion, they did.Disney, JJ Abrams, everyone involved - feel proud about yourselves. You made me forget the prequels ever existed, and made me feel like a 3 year old kid for two hours. Hope the same writers are involved with Episode 8 and find a way to mention that the prequels were ""some sort of mythology that never happened"", then i'll be a happy, true Star Wars fan!t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-TEN!"
ID_100031;6;10;"This movie hits every conceivable emotion, but above all, it's fun. Nowadays, we have so much dark gritty stuff which is great and deep, but it gets tiring. And, things that try to be fun come off as overly silly and dumbed down. The Force Awakens does something not many films have done successfully in a while; combine the two seamlessly into one balanced package. The prequels tried to do this, and it blew up in Lucas' face. The reason it works in this movie is that all the humour and drama comes naturally from the characters. Yes, the plot and beats are VERY similar to A New Hope, but that was a great movie. If it ain't broke, don't fix it. Besides, that's exactly what's been missing from movies lately. So don't listen to all these negative reviewers saying ""it's a remake"", or a ""rip-off"". Towards the end, it goes completely its own way becoming more like The Empire Strikes Back.Let's start with the characters. It's great to see the old characters back in action. The Han and Leia scenes could have easily felt like they were just in there for nostalgia factor, but they feel natural and factor into the plot. Given the vast number of characters, it's amazing how very few of them feel shoe-horned in. There are three that I can think of who did, but all three of them are confirmed to be in the next one, so I'll get my fix then. However, the real standouts are the new characters. Adam Driver brings unexpected depth to Kylo Ren. Oscar Isaac is intensely likable as Poe Dameron. John Boyega is great as Finn. But the best is Daisy Ridley as Rey. She is going to be in so much more stuff, I guarantee. The chemistry between her and Finn was one of my favourite parts of the movie.The cinematography is incredible. The camera never moved around in the originals. Here, it follows around the action, capturing the feeling of playing with toys as a kid more perfectly than any movie before. It also just feels so much like Star Wars. Every sound and image is familiar. The movie has a real presence; the practical effects make it feel real. John Williams' new score is great, of course. He does a great job integrating the old with the new. In fact, that would be my summary of the movie. It pays enough homage to the original while setting up an exciting new story. I like how not everything is revealed by the end of this film. The final shot perfectly sums up all the questions we are left with and foreshadows what to come. It may be one of my favourite final shots of a movie ever.In conclusion, some people are going to hate on it for being too much like the originals, others are going to complain that it's not enough like them. Some will say too many questions were answered, others will say that not enough were. In the end, there are so many expectations riding on this film that it will never live up to everyone's hype. It's a minor miracle what JJ did. He had to bring in all of the old, set up a sprawling galaxy of new, establish what's been going on for 30 years between films, add humour, add drama, and somehow make it cohesive and fun. If you go in with the understanding that this is a movie, not the second coming, you will leave immensely satisfied."
ID_100032;10;10;I know biased fanboys of the painfully average, outdated original trilogy will cluelessly cry about this, but yes, The Force Awakens is the most well made film of the Star Wars saga. This film has all the goodness of the original movies, characters who are easily likable, incredible effects, John Williams' rousing musical score and a great time at the cinema, enjoyable with our families and friends. But there are things which are even better than the original movies. Interaction between the lead characters is so natural, you got to commend the writers and the director J J Abrams for their amazing work. Most blockbuster films today tend to focus on spectacle and visual effects enhanced action over tender human moments. This film balances action and human drama amazingly well. The new characters are extremely memorable, the new actors Daisy Ridley and John Boyega are wonderful in their roles, along with Oscar Isaac. BB8 is extremely adorable, dare I say even better than R2D2. Adam Driver as Kylo Ren is a worthy villain, with the best motion capture actor in the world Andy Serkis, doing what he does best, as Supreme Leader Snoke. The visual effects on display here are incredible, and unlike the prequels which were ruined by their CGish feel, this one relies on practical effects. Almost everything in this film looks real, the stormtroopers look real, because they are real mean in armor, kudos for J J Abrams for not using CGI even for closeup shots of troopers. J J Abrams is a better director than George Lucas, and that will be very clear when you see the film. This film deserves every award and acclaim it received. A film as widely anticipated and hyped as this can rarely ever be this good, and yet........it is!
ID_100033;6;3;The moment they announced JJ Abhrams would direct the new Star Wars I feared the worst and my fears have come true. JJ Abhrams has done to Star Wars what he did to Stat Trek,make it a commercial success and nothing else. Star Wars is supposed to be more than commercial success...it's supposed to be more than special effects....it's supposed to be more than cheesy one liners which to be honest is not even funny.....it's supposed to be something that stays with you for a long long time,that's what episode 4 did to all its viewers. 15 minutes into the movie and we are introduced to the two new additions to the Star Wars universe who are going to take this franchise forward.But I'm sad to say for the 2 hours that followed you don't feel for either one of them.Imagine saying that to Han,Liea and Luke in episode 4!!! There is nothing wrong with the casting,it's the story that lets them done.They are just thrown at your face. The movie also suffers from major plot holes. They could have done anything with episode 7 but they ended up doing what all Star Wars fans feared just another film.
ID_100035;10;10;This movie is amazing, entertaining, and well crafted as a film in generalThe film is incredibly exciting with humor, action, references and a beautifully written plot. This movie will blow you away, as both a Star Wars fan and a movie fan. If you actually like Star Wars you will love this film, end of story.It is safe to say that J.J Abrams has fulfilled his mission in bringing back Star Wars to its former glory! Cannot wait for Episode 9!Rating: 10 out of 10
ID_100036;10;10;I simply cannot comprehend how anyone would give this a bad review. It was, without a doubt brilliant. The directing was amazing, to the point where you're so immersed in the scenes, I actually felt giddy during some of the flight scenes, it feels like you're actually IN the ship. The special effects are tastefully done, and are a perfect follow on from its predecessors. Nostalgia rules in this thrilling film, we felt like applauding several times throughout, and got goosebumps in some amazing scenes. It was also surprisingly humorous, (in appropriate amounts), and the balance of new characters versus returning characters and story lines was brilliant. 10 out of 10 for me!
ID_100037;10;10;"J.J Abrams has without a doubt constructed and delivered the best Star Wars film since Return of the Jedi. Better yet, the best Star Wars film after Empire. Evidence of this is by the wonderful cast of familiar and new characters, particular stand outs are Adam Driver and Daisy Ridley. The action was great, the story worked wonders. J.J added his genius, unique touch. As he did with Star Trek 2009 + Into Darkness.It did a wonderful job bridging the gap to a new story. Practical effects were 10/10. The older fans are just butthurt that more people are exposed to a new generation of incredible/better movies. TFA is simply perfection, as much as those laughable online trolls don't want you to believe ; )"
ID_100038;10;10;I'll be honest, in the months leading up to the release of JJ Abrams sequel I was growing increasingly skeptical about his ability to do the film justice. But after finally seeing it, I was SERIOUSLY impressed! Abrams is clearly a loyal, highly intelligent fan of the saga, and has done all Star Wars fans a great service. The pacing and flow of the film is a mixture of the original and prequel trilogy, and left me almost wishing Abrams had taken the reigns for the prequels as well. It is amazingly written and directed with stunning visuals and cinematography.The action is fast paced and flawless (the space battle scenes and light saber duels especially) and the story woven with emotion and the best occasional gags and one liners to date. I particularly enjoyed the character of Kylo Ren and was left begging for more backstory and information on this confused and helpless villain People certainly loved to point out downfalls in George Lucas' prequels, but it's factually obvious Abrams has completely delivered on all fronts in doing the saga justice! 10/10
ID_100039;10;10;I was lucky enough to see The Force Awakens on its release day and I'm glad to say that it was spectacular! The movie was well directed and a genuine Star Wars feel was evident throughout.Throughout the whole 2 and a half hour running time, I was treated to a masterpiece of visual effects as well as well as a compelling and convincing story which introduced the two new lead characters: Rey and Finn. I thought BB-8 was a humorous, cute character and can't wait to see more of him in the upcoming films. JJ Abrams did an amazing job creating easily the best film of the year.Out of all the Star Wars films, this is definitely the second best in the franchise (just BARELY behind The Empire Strikes Back)
ID_100040;2;2;"Context: I grew up on these films. I didn't think the first trilogy was the ""best thing ever made,"" but the story was gripping, the material was fresh, and I couldn't get enough of it. Hell, I can still remember playing the pod racer game on N64 after episode 1 came out and every time I would race, would relive the stories in my mind.It has become abundantly clear after sitting through this cash-cow that one can ascertain from fairly obvious decision-making for this film the following notions:1) There was NO intention of contributing to an amazing story. Instead the saga ripped-off general focal points from the previous films... Just to name a few: a larger Death Star, the same weapon/laser-beam on this larger Death Star, the only weakness of said giant Death Star, the only villain wearing a Vader-like mask.2) Success of the film largely will be based on (A) appealing to small children who cannot look away from bright shiny light and CGI effects, (B) loyal fans of the first trilogy who managed to hang in there for the 2nd trilogy (somewhat of a train-wreck) through introducing original cast-mates strategically over a 2-hour period forcing us to sit tight to the end.They made things even more apparent by recreated Chalmun's Spaceport Cantina on Tatooine. Throughout the entire film, I simply could not stop thinking that I was being tricked into paying just because they took advantage of my appreciation for the earlier movies.3) I briefly mentioned this, but it bears repeating: THE STORY WAS AWFUL!!! Little more could have been done to show how J.J. Abrams felt about this one... Sure, I'll credit him with a great rendition of Star Trek, but in Ep-7 I found it extremely difficult not to feel like during the development phase, he would often write a bit and then get bored with it whereby taking a huge bowel movement on that particular piece and proceeding on to the next scene.For example, when Han Solo finally reunited with Leia (aka Princess Leia) after 30 years... boy oh boy was that one of the most poorly designed representations of long-lost love between two people: upon seeing one another they put on a sad face whereby Chewbacca walks by and pats her on the back in such a casual way as if to say ""Whats up Laya.""This one gets two stars!I cannot help but feel some attachment to seeing Harrison Ford, Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher in their original roles just one last time.Ultimately, what made this entire experience a failure, was how the following two items were depicted: (1)The Force, (2)the Lightsabre.(1)THE FORCE: The fabric which lines this fantastically designed mythical world which has so much history. The Force was offered up as little more than a ""trick"" which may be learned with little training or dedication to having a greater understanding. Remember how long Luke spent trying to uncover all the different ways which the force encapsulates his world? He would duel blindfolded with a drone, gain incites into future events, connect with his sister through feeling the force, fetching the lightsaber out of snow while tied up in a cave about to be eaten by a yeti... you get the idea. Yet Rey spends about 2 minutes repeating a few words to a guard, thereby forcing him to release her, having completely harnessed something Luke doesn't manage for a greater portion of his time as a Jedi, well past the point where his training is announced as complete by Yoda. It felt as if the writers simply were instructed to skip addressing this aspect of Rey because it would take away from all the cheap, effortless ways by which to garner more paying viewers. (2)LIGHTSABER: How many different people were going to casually whip out Luke's lightsaber during tight situations? It was ridiculous how often this would occur...But I digress... I shan't keep you away any longer... If you're a small child or never cared for any of the originals, then this film is for you. But for everyone else out there who grew up on the first trilogy, it has been despicable to see how these people have taken advantage of such an amazing story in exchange for ticket sales... Having said all that, I am beginning to question the ratings. At one point this site was the most reliable source for film reviews (Rotten Tomatoes always seemed to be the biased place), however after seeing the overall rating and many of the initial reviews (of which I AM CERTAIN the consensus for this film is not in the 80% range), this site is losing the usefulness it once had.And a ""Top 250"", no less? Yea right... The review system is losing its validity. Now I notice a pattern immediately after release whereby numerous fake accounts are created which then give raving 10-star reviews. It's so clear what is happening there, but IMDb seems not to have a solution nor want to fix the problem.----- 2/10 STARS -------- Review by Searsino -----"
ID_100042;10;10;"So, my opinion of this movie is that it is the ""greatest movie of all time."" WHY? Let us get started. Number One: This movie is the first one to be in Sphero's ""Watch with me"" features with its BB-8. If you have a BB-8 from Sphero, you get what I mean if you have iPhone 5s or later. Number Two: The music by John Williams is FANTASTIC! I am so mad at the Academy that it did not give John Williams and Oscar for his music!!!!! This movie is his 50th Oscar nomination! WHY THE HELL DID THEY NOT GIVE HIM AN Oscar!?!?!?!??!?!Number Three: The old characters finally return. Bad news, is that George Lucas is not there to help make it, so that is a bit a problem that does not matter. Number Four: This movie is similar to Star Wars: A New Hope.Number Five: Daisy Ridley's performance as Rey is GREAT! Even though she is not my favorite person, she really got her talent through and she made the production quicker. I agree with some people that she is fun to watch.Those are the five main reasons why this movie is the greatest movie of all time. May the force be with The Force Awakens."
ID_100043;10;10;I have grown up with Star Wars. I was nine when I went to the original. Empire Strikes Back is my favourite film of all time and I don't care what the basement detractors say, I liked the prequels and they get an undeserved bad rap. They're movies, they're entertaining, get over it. The Force Awakens has everything you want in a Star Wars movie. The acting was good, as was the action and special effects. If you're a fan you owe it to yourself to go see it. If you're a hater you probably still will and then spend the rest of your time on the net complaining how George Lucas raped your childhood and JJ is a hack. Don't listen to the pathetic haters, go see it for yourself. You won't be disappointed!10/10
ID_100044;10;10;"With this absolute epic, Star Wars.....is......back! JJ Abrams achieved a small miracle in creating a movie that respects its original material, brings in a ton of new characters, makes it appealing for new viewers and sets up a story to build a new Star Wars trilogy on. Without giving away too many spoilers, the story revolves around a scavenger (Rey), a renegade stormtrooper(Finn) and a fighter pilot(Poe) in their quest to defeat an enemy with the power to endanger the galaxy. To be honest, actual great acting has never been a strong point in any of the previous Star Wars movies. This trend has thankfully been broken, as the stellar cast give great performances throughout the whole movie. The newcomers Daisy Ridley and John Boyega, playing as Rey and Finn respectively, prove themselves more than capable of carrying the load in continuing the saga. They both show great chemistry together and give us extremely likable characters, with Rey bringing the heart of the film and Finn the abundant energy. Oscar Isaacs, who plays Poe, is the veteran among the young cast and pulls of a cool and smart-ass X-wing pilot. And finally, the old cast returns to give this film a true Star Wars feel to it. Harrison Ford returns as Han Solo and has not seemed to skip a beat since 1983, as he is as cheeky and bad-ass as ever. His witty banter with Chewbacca is a pleasure to watch, but Ford also brings a strong emotional performance this time too. Carrie Fisher as Leia also returns, in a rather small role, and delivers some sweet scenes with Han and the new cast. However, the most complex character with the best arc in this movie, is the antagonist Kylo Ren. Ren, played by Adam Driver, gives us an extremely intimidating villain with a troubled past we are eager to discover. Ultimately, he serves us more than a Darth Vader wannabe. JJ Abrams alongside Lawrence Kasdan wrote a fun and entertaining screenplay with plenty of emotional plot twists and content. Each main character has its own background and motivation, which develops over the duration of the film. A pleasant surprise to see is the humor used in the movie. The comedic relief in the film was used very effectively in developing chemistry and sympathy for the characters. It is also a sign that the movie does not take itself too seriously as the prequels did. The Force Awakens is filled with exhilarating action and moves with great pace during these scenes. Yet, Abrams knows to slow it down during scenes conveying intense emotion giving the audience time to process all that is thrown at them. These combined make it easy to understand the main characters' motivations, making the emotional investment so much better. As is typical of Star Wars, the movie is full of awe inspiring visual images and astonishing sound editing, creating new sounds for laser beams, light sabers, and alien noises. The cinematography is equally impressive, showing beautiful landscape shots of new planets reminiscent of the original trilogy. The cinematographer also shows us a diverse array of shots, giving heart- pounding POV shots inside the cockpit and nice long shots of the battlefield giving it a great scope while avoiding confusion caused by the numerous explosions. John Williams makes a welcome return to the Star Wars franchise with a bombastic new score, but also with nicely timed inserts of his famous original music to bring up emotional heartwarming feeling among the old-school fans. In conclusion, The Force Awakens is a return to greatness for the Star Wars franchise. This beautiful reunion of old characters combined with the introduction of promising new characters results in an emotional, adventure trip that left me excited for what is coming next. To quote Jimmy Kimmel, this movie was probably ""the most anticipated sequel since the New Testament"". So expect this movie to be under the most intense scrutiny by reviewers as they dissect the movie to its core to find the tiniest (I.E. laughably non-existent) flaws. In the end, The Force Awakens delivers as a fantastic Star Wars film and an incredibly worthy addition to the franchise."
ID_100045;10;10;Episode 7 has redeemed a franchise that, for many traditional fans, had become a niggling source of disappointment.This is everything that 1, 2 & 3 weren't. The acting is solid - something we've never really associated with the franchise. The music is not clichéd - there are some new themes which will most likely catch on. The storyline is coherent and promises longevity and the action is gripping. From the opening scene you realise that 32 years after Return of the Jedi and the utter disappointment of 1, 2 & 3, Star Wars fans are finally in for a incredible treat!It is a return to what worked. The directing is solid as is the dialogue. In fact, it's the best dialogue in all eight films. 5*
ID_100046;10;10;I don't need to pathetically hyper analyze it to love it. It was brilliant from start to finish. Unlike the godawful Lord of the Rings films, which are completely unwatchable. I really loved the movie, can't wait to watch it again. I wasn't sure what JJ Abrams would do with the film but he has been unbelievably great for the franchise. It gets really emotional at times and is just an absolute pleasure to watch. It felt like it was 1980 again. It's great to see this franchise resurrected and it was a beautifully natural continuation that delivered in spades! #TYJJ
ID_100047;5;7;"Before I start writing this review, I want to say I'm a huge fan of George Lucas' Universe. I have the 6 previous movies on Blu-Ray, which I love very much. I also played the games, watched Star Wars the Clone Wars film and TV show as well as reading the books.So I was eager to see this brand new episode of the main saga. The first without George Lucas in command. I heard good things about JJ Abrams and how he turned all he touched in gold so I was expecting a lot. At the end I am quite disappointed.It would be wrong to say everything is bad in this movie. It's still entertaining and enjoyable to watch. But I expected so much more of it. It's not any kind of saga we are talking here. It's a classic one which enchanted so many fans throughout the world for several decades. This is Star Wars and it should be something which will stay in memories whatever happens. And about that, it fails big times as it levels down with the average blockbusters of the genre. It has lost its magic. It's so saddening really and truly something I would have never foreseen. Even the Emperor wouldn't have.The only appealing side of 'The Force Awakens' and the only thing that seems to work almost correctly was the come back of the original cast. I wont lie, it's great to see Harrison Ford, Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher back. When Han Solo and Chewbacca appear for the first time and listening Ford saying ""Chewie we're home"", I had a shiver. It was maybe the only time it did or was it another one when we see Leia and Han seeing each other for the first time.The rest of the cast is not bad but because of the lack of vision haunting this movie until the end, the characters are quite shallow. They have potential but you really need to dig much deeper to allow them expressing it completely. The only new face I really appreciated was BB8 the new droid. He is not as brave as R2D2 but his mimics melted me. He's really cute and sympathetic.Now lets talk about the mishaps. JJ Abrams missed his target. We never wished to see a copy & paste of the Original trilogy even if it's much bigger and stronger. What I was expecting was a movie which would be as visionary as the original story. So at the end I would have the feeling that despite all I've seen about Star Wars, it will still keep surprising me by bringing something new.Instead we have a fast-forwarded and very poorly written version of A New Hope and Return of The Jedi. The new characters are just the 2016 alter egos of the 1977 ones. There is absolutely not a single drop of originality throughout the movie. We have no difficulty to understand that Rey is related to Luke because like him she is stranded in a desert planet, trying to make a living by scavenging ships. Finn is just the black version of Han Solo. He wants to get out of the grip of the First Order aka The Galactic Empire or what's left of it, just like Han Solo wanted to escape from Jabba the Hutt. BB8 is R2D2, the only hope for the Resistance aka the Rebel Alliance, to save themselves from the Order. Kylo Ren is Anakin/Darth Vader who betrayed Luke as his grand father betrayed Obi Wan in a very identical way. And Han Solo is taking the role of Obi Wan as the iconic member getting killed by the bad guy. Like I said a copy & paste!So yes JJ Abrams definitely missed what makes the Star Wars Saga essence: the story. The Force Awakens hasn't any story. It has no vision. It may work for a movie like Transformers but you do that with Star Wars and you're digging your grave. As JJ Abrams used most of the material provided by the first trilogy, should I expect that he will pillage the Prequel trilogy for Episode 8? I would suggest JJ to use George Lucas for the next episode scriptwriting but as they are already producing Episode 8 while the Force Awakens is still available on theaters, I think we will enjoy another epic failure. George, Come Back!"
ID_100048;10;9;I mean honestly, what do these whiny nerds want? Prior to episode 7, I distinctly remember die-hard fans complaining how the prequels were pure garbage. Now you're all saying you miss the prequels? XD XD XDThis movie was great! I'm seriously baffled by some of these reviews. I'm sure if this series is ever rebooted, or another entry releases in 20+ years, you'll all yearn for JJ's Star Wars. You people have no idea what you want and will just complain no matter what is put forth. Cut the crap.I thought this movie was great. The new characters, Finn and Rey, were instantly likable, and the inclusion of old favorites felt natural. I highly recommend this film and I think most NORMAL people will enjoy it.
ID_100049;10;10;Before watching The Force Awakens, I was slightly skeptical. However, I can safely say I am now a HUGE fan of the Star Wars universe!The Force Awakens stands as a rock-solid foundation of a promising trilogy, which will easily surpass the original trilogy if this incredibly high standard of film making is carried forward.Clearly J.J. Abrams enjoyed every minute of work when directing this movie, and he expresses his love for the Star Wars franchise extremely well by respecting the original material and cleverly linking the trilogies and simultaneously building new, strong characters who rival even the classics such as Han or Luke. Overall, I would say that TFA is a must-see movie, not only for fans of the Star Wars franchise, but for anyone who has access to a television screen. J.J Abrams does an absolutely masterful job at showing his love and passion for Star Wars, and the finished products (Yay Episode 9!!!!) will all go down in history as some of the greatest films of any trilogy in history.
ID_100050;10;9;"I love Star Wars, especially the original stuff, of course. The Force Awakens stays true to the original trilogy; with the start of the film on a Tatooine-like planet, Jakku, as per usual. It follows the thrilling journey of the brilliant Poe of the Resistance and Finn of past Storm trooper relation, at first, as you are thrown into the blistering excitement. But then there is a twist in the main hero being a girl. It works both simply for a change, but also in that it is pretty much a first in as big a film as Star Wars that the main character is a female. That wouldn't matter, though, if the character wasn't a likable hero, or if the acting wasn't any good. Fortunately, those boxes are ticked, as with every character in the film bar Snoke, who is an example of bad CGI, unfortunately. He doesn't play a very big part, though, and other than him the special effects are fantastic — with the use of more practical effects being a refreshing move from Lucasarts, and one that the film benefits from, as it doesn't look artificial like so many films do nowadays (The Hobbit, Star Wars prequels, Avengers, etc).Along with the great use of practical effects, there are fantastically designed costumes all over the joint, with great designs ranging from the new-look storm troopers to Kylo Ren and his super cool outfit.Going back to character, though, the move from Disney to advertise Finn as the main Jedi was clever, as it meant for the reveal of Rey as the Jedi to be much better than otherwise could have been possible. Finn, though, is a fantastic character, with John Boyega deserving more nominations than he's received for his charismatic performance. One other thing done well with The Force Awakens is the lack of slow story development which so marred the progress of the prequel films, and A New Hope, and also the decision to focus on characters to develop the story other than excess plot development means for better character development and means you actually like the characters, unlike Episodes I, II and III. Moreover, the return of light-heartedness and inclusion of comedy makes it an even more enjoyable watch; however, mixed with darker themes clearly inspired by the best parts of Episode III, there is more violence and concentration on action — with that providing excitement, and the comedy bringing extra enjoyment. Finn personifies the more light- hearted approach along with the brilliant BB8, and Kylo Ren is a fantastic vehicle for the darker side of the film, who I love – even though some people might think he's a bit of a snotty nosed dork. Kylo Ren is probably just as good a villain as Darth Maul in my opinion at least, but he's used much, much better, fortunately. Ah, yes. The Phantom Menace. Let's all remind ourselves of that excellent part of film history. Good for you and me, though, we can forget about that now, because we have the sequel trilogy, which could even be better than the original if they keep on getting things right like they did with this film.One more thing I'm grateful was done right was the score. A mixture of both classic tracks and new ones, it's fantastic in both providing towards all the drama and the overall feel of the film. Because, by using both old tracks and new ones it reminds you of the past (sparking your nostalgia) whilst also bringing something new, which the film does fantastically with every aspect; from the story to the cast to the sets to the action and to the (you guessed it) score. Other than being a tad ridiculous in some plot turns, and lacking quite the same grandness of scale in sets and cast that the original films did – but only just, mind you; it's pretty much perfect in what it has set out to do; providing excitement, enjoyment, drama, action and nostalgia in abundance. Enough for a boy like me to squeal.Verdict:The Force Awakens is the main product of Disney's buy out, and so I'm very happy Disney got involved if it meant this beast of a film was made. It was almost a dream of mine that there would be a sequel trilogy, and it has actually happened, so I was aptly excited. My excitement was repaid emphatically, as when I sat in the cinema fulfilling one of my most anticipated pipe dreams, I was blown away by this surprisingly light-hearted yet violent, action packed and particularly well crafted, yes, beast of a film.So I give it: 94/100."
ID_100051;7;2;When it comes to this, it seems that there really isn't much of substance to this movie. Various things happen, a lot of commotion on the screen, but where do they ultimately lead? What is the bigger picture? Truth is that there isn't even a bigger picture. What we see, is all that is and it is nothing particularly exciting even if they try to mask the hollowness behind a bunch of explosions, shootings and other stuff. To be honest, I see no difference between this Star Wars movie or any average Michael Bay movie. Plot wise it's about as deep as Transformers. We have got Harisson Fordie back and Carrie Fisher and that weird blonde dude. Carrie used to be smoking in the 80's. I mean, she does look a bit like a farmer from 19th century, but in that slave outfit, even if the movie was bland as hell, I could still enjoy the sight of her cleavage. But now she's 60 and that sight isn't particularly attractive to me anymore. And Ford? He used to be such a man in the 80's. But now he's just an old man, who looks like he should be at a retirement home watching TV with other old people. And the blonde dude is just as annoying as he was. He ain't a Jedi. Just a farm boy. This movie really lacks in every department imaginable. How you suppose for me to enjoy a piece like this when there's nothing beyond the sparkling facade? Where's the emotion? Where's the depth? In my opinion Star Wars has to be one of the worst franchises imaginable and I will never associate myself with any person that belongs to it's fan base.
ID_100052;8;8;"Star Wars: The Force Awakens. A new story about old stories. The obvious thing is that the new film of the new trilogy looks very nice, even when compared with the films of the 2000s, and especially when compared with the original trilogy. But, the story itself very strongly in some places begins to resemble the ""New Hope"". There are Darth Vader, Luke Skywalker and others in this film, but in a more different form, which is why history begins to repeat itself accordingly. But even with these moments, you want to watch the new Star Wars, because it's all just as beautiful and interesting. New characters have entered this huge universe well and I hope they will take root well in it."
ID_100053;6;7;1977 was a big year in the cinema. Star Wars (later titled Episode IV-A New Hope) came out. It was a big year for me as well. I went to see my first James Bond film in the cinema. Star Wars I saw some years later on television, which as my brother said 20 minutes in. It is just some characters walking in the desert.JJ Abrams who ran out of ideas by the time he went on to direct Star Trek: Into Darkness has not waited long to reuse old ideas for Star Wars 7. Just as Creed carries on the Rocky saga by going back to Rocky 1 & 2, Abrams with Lawrence Kasdan & Michael Arndt has gone back to A New Hope to set up this new trilogy.We are back to the world of Star Wars and with advances in technology, special effects, CGI and animatronics we have not advanced much in visuals from the original trilogy which is over 30 years old from The Return of the Jedi. The visuals are uninspired and rather lazy.We have a Tattooine like planet where a young woman, Rey meets a droid carrying important information regarding Luke Skywalker. Rey comes across Finn a storm-trooper who has had a reawakening of his own and met a rebel fighter to escape.Rey seems to be feeling the force and in a series of coincidences or I guess the power of the force escapes her pursuers in a wreck which turns out to be the Millennium Falcon and later comes across Han Solo and Chewbacca.That is not all the Darth Vader like baddie is the grandson of Darth Vader, the son of Han and Princess Leia who has gone over to the dark side but still conflicted with the power of good. Their will be a father and son reunion and you can all guess how this will turn out as the scene is reminiscent of when Obi Wan encountered Darth Vader.It is entertaining, they put on all the right beats with action scenes coming at the right time and some humour, star cameos such as Daniel Craig voicing a storm-trooper or an actress, Harriet Walter who is the niece of Christopher Lee. It is just the story has been recycled and you think that after 30 years, this is the best they could do?If Lucas wanted a new trilogy he might has well remastered and re- edited his original trilogy because I know where this is heading.
ID_100054;10;10;Well, what can I say. First, let me state I'm 42 years old and a massive Star Wars fan. And if there's one reason why this movie is so fantastic, it's that I saw the same wonder and magic in my daughter's eyes that I had when I was a young boy.They did it! They finally managed to bring the Star Wars universe to life. All the bad things from the prequels are gone, all the good parts from the originals are back. It's exciting, funny, spectacular, emotional and everything a Star Wars movie should be. What an achievement from the entire team of director, producers, cast and designers. So many things to love about this. I had been waiting for this for SO long, and god I'm so happy it lived up to my hopes for it.Can't wait to see what's coming!
ID_100055;3;1;And I thought Jar Jar Binks was the pits for this movie series. Jeeez, was I wrong.They have now managed to turn this into a politically correct, both when it comes to sex and race, boring and totally non-entertaining pile of horse manure, that not even the most hard-core Star Wars fan could possibly like.And Harrison Ford? Oh man.. why oh why? BB-8 was probably the only one in the whole show that managed the upgrade from the past till the present, with any kind of dignity.Please. Please. Stop doing this. Make movies for adults with a brain, instead of for 12-year olds with Alzheimer.
ID_100057;10;10;Words cannot describe the perfection that is this film. JJ Abrams did a fantastic job, better than anything Lucas could do/ever has done. Solid cast, action, effects, everything. Go see this film, even if you're not a Star Wars fan, because you will become one. I'll definitely be seeing this multiple times, and I cannot wait to see the future of Star Wars in Episodes 8, 9 and the spin off movies. And thankfully, there isn't any Jar Jar Binks or young Anakin Skywalker. Instead we have interesting, diverse and excellently played characters. What a film.5/5 stars, 10/10, Best movie of 2015, Best Star Wars movie....by far : )
ID_100058;10;10;"J.J. Abrams has crafted a fantastic new episode of Star Wars in the classic style of the original trilogy, restoring competence, humor, convincing dialogue and acting, thrills, spills and chills. He has created new, likable characters that the audience can actually get behind, instead of be annoyed, disconnected and detached from, as in the widely-derided prequel trilogy. The film was (thankfully) crafted as the ""anti-prequel."" Don't believe the chorus of entitled nerds who set their own unrealistic personal expectations for the film and got mad when the film wasn't the perfect fulfillment of those demands. The film has been widely praised by professional critics as one of the best films of 2015. Abrams has brought Star Wars back, and has left Star Wars fans hungry for more!..............Ten X- )"
ID_100059;10;10;The original cast is back and fits in beautifully with the new crew. The CGI are great and the movie as a whole is A MASTERPIECE.This movie did a brilliant job of taking new actors with a new story (this is Star Wars for the new generation after all) and combined them with the original actors and clever references to the original trilogy. The dialogue was perfect for this movie (and very much in JJ Abrams' style) with just enough witty banter and clever one liners to keep you amused amidst all the serious action.And finally that brings me to the action. it was believable, and was perfectly reminiscent of the original trilogy. It is its own wonderful movie but is still definitively Star Wars. I recommend this to any fan of the franchise, any younger fans, fans of a good action and adventure movie, or fans of just incredible filmmaking period!
ID_100060;10;10;From the the intro to the very end credits, I had goosebumps all the  way. Ignore the hate, because this was the best Star Wars movie so far,  I can't wait for Episodes 8 and 9.  I smiled all the way and never had so much joy in a cinema before. This  movie gives you the Star Wars feeling we all love from the original  trilogy. I wanted to go to the toilet so bad, but I got so in into  movie I never went. The film is simply brilliant. It is not in anyway a  remake of Episode 4, they should try actually re-watching A New Hope.    I recommend this movie to everyone!
ID_100061;10;10;Finally Star Wars is back in full force! Beautiful acting, stunning practical effects and a great story. Now that the theme has been set, there are a lot of paths which the next installments could go down. My only complaint is that 2 hours and 15 minutes went by so damn quick that it felt like barely 30 minutes and I wanted MORE! XD. All in all this makes for a great Star Wars.
ID_100062;10;10;I have no idea why there is so much hate on this movie. This is one of my favorite movies ever! This passed the original by an absolute landslide! There are three very critical reasons why it is better than the original:1) Better effects - Obviously the effects are going to surpass the original because of the time difference.2) Better plot - In the original, the plot was......fine, but this one brings a whole new level of greatness 3) The New Jedi - Not going to say who it is, but I love this person a lot!All in all, I would definitely recommend watching this amazing movie!!!
ID_100063;10;10;"I vaguely remember my first introduction to Star Wars. My uncle had taken me with his family to see some horror flick at the Drive-in about a ship that needed to kill people in order to keep the engine running; I seem to remember grey uniforms and it might have a gun ship of some kind? I don't remember too well; I was young, it was gross, and so I didn't pay attention. Looking out the back window of the station wagon, I saw the opening scenes of Empire Strikes Back. I spent the rest of the time entranced, even without having any sound. My first ""grown up"" movie in a normal theater was Return of the Jedi. My mom had the Beta disks. I wore them out. I had the tape series. I wore it out. twice. Then, the movies were re-released. And altered. And the death spiral of the series began.Most everyone complains about how annoying the prequels were. I was more wondering how they ever got made with so much blatant bigoted stereotyping. I have a thick skin for that sort of stuff, and I was starting to get offended. On top of very thoroughly documented complaints already raised against those rejects.But this.... This brought back all the wonder, all the excitement of that little 5 year old looking through the back window, so many years ago. This IS the sequel we have been waiting 30 years for. And it was worth the wait.Old school effects mixed with CGI, the classic musical score, a director that knew where to go and why, actors new enough to push their roles, while still experienced enough to successfully play them. Just enough questions answered to leave you fulfilled, while several obviously still await answers.This is all we hoped for."
ID_100064;10;10;Just saw Star Wars: The Force Awakens. Having seen all the movies at least one time each, The Force Awakens was exactly what I wanted it to be. A nod at the aging characters of the original trilogy and the setup for the next two movies. I typically do not write reviews, I just have to say I get such a kick out of the people that give this movie a low rating and share their vitriol filled breakdown of the film. I suppose it is why I only tune in for the first two weeks of American Idol, it's funny to watch a bunch of people lacking talent shaking their fists at why their vision of truth is not accepted by the masses.The damage you funny reviewers have done must be very disappointing to JJ Abrams and Co. And last I checked the overall IMDb rating is an oh-so low 8.1. (AKA ridiculously high by IMDb rating standards) Again, simply hilarious!
ID_100065;10;10;Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens is an incredible reboot/sequel that successfully combines the new with the old in an emotional, consistently funny and thrilling revitalisation of the Skywalker saga. Daisy Ridley, John Boyega and Oscar Isaac are all incredible. Adam Driver is also incredible as Kylo Ren, the franchise's most interesting and compelling villain. Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher are also incredible with their returning characters having grown and evolved since episode VI. It's expertly paced without a single scene dragging or being boring. The music by John Williams is once again reliably perfect. J. J. Abrams' direction is excellent and the film is visually stunning with excellent CG. It also has a fantastic lightsaber fight.
ID_100066;8;6;Yes, the action and cgi are good. Sadly the movie drowns in it and leaves no room for the Star Wars story. As some other reviewer already pointed out, yes it is a remake of part IV. When part I came out the audience was not happy, they missed something. How is it possible that one can watch part 4 - 6 every year, part 1 - 3 every couple of years and part VII once every 10 years? Same thing with all the other movies like Star Trek: the future begins, the Tranformers trilogy, the latest Avanger movies, when does one get tired of 2 hours only action, action and more action? This movie just does not have the George Lucas touch, it is another mainstream brave Disney family action movie. Part 4 - 6 had some pretty daring scenes, Leila in exciting cloths, this movie everyone is wrapped from head to toe, so damn brave it makes you sick. I conclude to say it's another victim of Disney.
ID_100067;10;10;"I'm a veeeeery long-term Star Wars fan, since back in '77.The Force Awakens was absolutely brilliant - everyone in the IMAX cinema clapped and cheered at the end. And it was a mixed audience too, not just Star Wars nerds like myself.I would describe this movie as a Star Wars that's real and gritty - I felt immersed in every scene, and not once was the spell broken, unlike the tragic prequels.The acting was superb, cinematography was amazing, and I could never tell when CGI was being used! Story was excellent with some unexpected twists, music great as always, action sequences were breathtaking. Everyone in the cinema was quite emotional by the end. I don't know how some people are giving this a low rating, they must be paid trolls getting that big payola payday from someone. LOL just kidding, that's literally the single dumbest thing i've ever heard. XDLooking forward to watching this again and again!Thanks J.J. for coming through ; )"
ID_100069;10;10;This is actually better than the originals i love all star wars films but im watching back the originals and honestly they are so boring the prequels and the new sequel trilogy so far are way better honestly this film is better than a new hope and honestly its not even that much of a remake its kinda different there are some bits the same but this is way better than all 3 of the originals. So people who are saying this is rubbish ur just being ungrateful coping what those few other people are saying and making up little stories bout other people hating it because your all low lifes this is one of the best star wars films only behind ROTS and LJ. Plus most people who watched this film obviously love it because it made like over 2 billion in the box office and raked even more money when dvd was released
ID_100070;8;10;"I really don't care what anyone has to say because I personally thought this film was nearly flawless. Sure, it's hard to say that it wasn't a clone of ""A New Hope"", but honestly, it's hard not to go back to old material. The Force Awakens was a thrilling and delectably exciting film that introduced us to fun and loveable new characters (BB8, I'm talking to you!), while simultaneously embracing the original characters. The film got us absolutely pumped for the next film which was an unfortunate misfire, but didn't matter at the time because of how good this one was.A+"
ID_100071;10;10;I purposely waited 24 hours before writing my review because I wanted to digest the film that long to truly take it in and reflect before I actually reviewed it. I wanted the euphoria of seeing the next chapter of the saga on the big screen to subside some so that I can make an objective review, but alas the euphoria has not subsided and the childlike excitement is still at an 11! This is plain and simply a great Star Wars film! In fact, I feel it is the second best offering of the franchise (behind 'The Empire Strikes Back'). From the opening crawl to the epic and somewhat moving final scene the movie kept you on the edge of your seat. Even now, 24 hours later, I'm still left in awe of what Abrams has done. He has ignited a passion in me that has lied dormant for a decade thanks to the dreadful prequel trilogy. After Episode III I vowed never to see another George Lucas Star Wars film ever again. The prequels were cheesy (and not in a good way) and lacked imagination. They borrowed heavily from the expanded universe (which flies in the face of his original assertion that he had planned out the prequels before Episode IV was even made) and spat in the face of Star Wars fans everywhere. Lucas is now (thankfully) out of the picture and in steps admitted Star Wars fan J.J. Abrams who is quickly establishing himself as this generations Steven Spielberg. Abrams intention was to reignite the franchise and call upon his own boyhood wonderment when seeing the original trilogy for the first time and try to recreate that with the sequel by meshing old and new to weave a new chapter in the saga. What Abrams has done so well here is he's managed to keep the older cast members relevant while also creating new characters who feel like they've always been part of the story. He's been able to expertly bridge the generation gap and bond the older cast members with the new ones to create a cohesive story that is not only enjoyable to watch, but really FEELS like a Star Wars film from the epic battle scenes, music, costumes, sets - every part of the film, even down to the bits and pieces that Rey scavenges oozes STAR WARS and it is fantastic. I won't delve into the plot for fear of spoiling it, but the film obviously revolves around a core of new characters in the Star Wars Universe - Rey, a young scavenger who lives on the desert planet of Jakku, Finn a former Stormtrooper who is desperate to escape the clutches of The First Order, Poe Dameron the top fighter pilot of the Resistance and his trusty droid BB-8, and Kylo Ren, a member of the First Order and a wannabe Sith who acts as the main antagonist of the film. There are other supporting cast including General Hux, a First Order General, Captain Phasma, the leader of the Stormtroopers, Maz Kanata, a pirate and collector of artifacts, and Supreme Leader Snoke who is the leader of the First Order. Several former characters are weaved into the film with Han Solo and Chewbacca seeing the majority of the screen time from that group. The connection between old and new is a constant theme in the film and it is pulled off masterfully. The film is an emotional roller-coaster from beginning to end and is a movie that I will always cherish thanks to it's re- ignition of my love for the franchise. There isn't much more that I can say other than if you are even remotely a fan of the Star Wars Universe you owe it to yourself to see this. Even if you are not, there is a lot to keep you entertained here and you never know, it may turn you into a fan of the franchise if you're not careful, regardless quit reading this and go see it!
ID_100072;10;10;I simply can not comprehend how anyone would give this a bad review! It was, without a doubt, brilliant. The directing was amazing, to the point where you're so immersed in the scenes, I actually felt giddy during some of the flight scenes. The special effects are tastefully done, and are a perfect follow on from its predecessors. Nostalgia rules in this thrilling film, we felt like applauding several times throughout, and got goosebumps in some amazing scenes. It was also surprisingly humorous, (in appropriate amounts), and the balance of new characters vs returning characters and story lines was brilliant. 10 out of 10 for me. Go see it, you won't regret it.
ID_100073;6;5;"Return of the Jedi had a solid ending and to continue this story you have to do better than (spoiler alert) give us no context in A New Hope Reboot that just happens to say Episode VII The force Awakens.There aren't any planets we haven't seen before. Jakku is Tatooine with war machines that crash landed on it's surface.(Spoiler Alert) A Coruscant TYPE planet get's destroyed along with 5 other planets with the Death Star 3 that takes energy from the sun. It get's blown up in the same way. All of our hero's efforts in the Original Trilogy is undone.The effort of our heroes being undone would be more acceptable if the enemy was completely different from the one in the OT. Another power arising as a threat would have been fine.(Spoiler alert) The point of the Prequels was to show how a war get's started and how power can be brought into the wrong hands by war. The Phantom Menace starts out with everything being fine and by ROTS everything goes downhill.Here everything goes downhill from a time where we are lead to think everything would be fine.If this was a different story I could accept this but it's not. I thought it was better than Attack of the Clones objectively. What get's me is they treated the movie like almost all ideas in the Prequels were terrible so don't have ideas. Don't try to expand the universe. (Sarcasm) It's not like Star Wars has endless potential or anything right? It's just the same thing over and over again.The Prequels made me expect too much I suppose. I mean we got Georges creative mind behind everything. We got PodRacing, Gungans (they're awesome forget about the overused character Jar Jar for a second), A giant war between what seems to be 2 disposable armies but it makes for some amazing footage, seeing what it means when Obi Wan told Luke your eyes can deceive you don't trust them with the saber fights, and the overall result ending with despair but a glimmer of hope.I felt like this film made the Original Trilogy look bad in making it completely irrelevant.Were there mistakes made with the prequels, well, yes but no one properly learned from them. Georges ideas with script doctoring and good execution that's how you do STAR WARS! That is how the Force works!I ""Hope"" Rouge One is stronger with it! They need a film to distract from this last one for a while."
ID_100074;10;10;The Force Awakens is the illustration of an emotional moment for me. Whenever I watch it I feel ... something. An emotion that is very personal, dark, sad, yet very happy. This film was the turning point from being the optimistic, emotional mute, happy yet dumb kid to the anxious, critical, emotional yet still optimistic teen. So much of my personal thoughts and feeling where forced onto this movie. So much memories of drawing Rey, Finn, and Kylo Ren from the trailers with my friends. So much memories of countless lunches just debating what the plot will be about and who the narrator was from the trailers is. It took over my life. Now at this moment in my life I was told to be more of a man. I had a strict rule with myself that no crying, no bad thoughts, no emotional things would be allowed in this body of mine. During my first midnight premiere, dressed up and pumped up. I cried for the first time I can ever remember. It all got released and it changed me. It's one of the most important moments in my 15 years of being alive. I also gained an interest in film that has never left me to this day. Oh and the film was amazing by the way.
ID_100075;6;3;Didnt watch these films for a long time, as the prequel trilogy was a bust...how could these be any good, and boy was I right.Theyre just taken star wars, and made it cheaper and dumber overall.The story itself isnt too bad, but the plot is so ridiculous, its hard not to laugh.How this band of essentially bumbling idiots manage to topple the new regime, by just basically bumbling around, its laughableWhereas the original trilogy showed the growth and depth required for the main characters to do what they did, here they just idiotically stumble around and things just succeed.And the entire force element has also been dumbed down. Gone is the mystique and depth, now everyone is a master of the force, now everyone is a master of light sabre combat...because why or how?Theres no explanation how these people got so good at what they do, they just magically 'got good'.Technically and visually its really good, but oh so stupid if you think about any of it for a mere second.
ID_100076;6;6;While it was good to see a new Star Wars movie on the big screen I strongly felt that despite some fun scenes overall it was not that memorable. To sum up my experience, Star Wars: The Force Awakens was nothing new. I feel conflicted here. Yes it was a good time filler. Yes it was good to see a new entry into the Star Wars franchise. But the movie just felt like it was going over old ground, and it's nothing that hasn't been done before.Star Wars: The Force Awakens takes place 30 years after the destruction of the second Death Star which occurred in Return of the Jedi (1983). Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), the last Jedi, has disappeared. The First Order led by Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) has risen from the fallen Galactic Empire and seeks to eliminate Luke and the Republic. The Resistance, backed by the Republic and led by Luke's twin sister, General Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher), opposes them while searching for Luke to enlist his aid.Resistance pilot Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) is captured and interrogated by Kylo Ren following an unsuccessful operation to capture Poe's droid BB-8 which is carrying vital information on the whereabouts of Luke Skywalker. A storm trooper who wants to leave his past behind named Finn (John Boyega) helps Poe escape and crash lands onto planet Jakku where he runs into BB-8 and Rey (Daisy Ridley), a resourceful scavenger. After escaping in the iconic Millennium Falcon following an air strike Rey, Finn and BB-8 encounter Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and Chewbacca where they embark on a quest to locate Luke Skywalker as well as evading Kylo Ren and the First Order.It was a trip down nostalgic lane catching up with Han Solo, Leia, Luke Skywalker, Chewbacca, R2-D2 and C-P30. The franchise receives a welcome injection of new blood with Rey, Finn, Poe, and Kylo Ren. Out of the new characters I liked Rey the most, and I hope to see her again in the franchise should there be a sequel. She's resourceful, adventurous, and appealing. I liked Finn but I must have missed why he grew tired of becoming a storm trooper. Kylo Ren was just another version of Darth Vader and Darth Maul but I thought his lightsaber looked more intimidating that the character itself.The plot was just like the same old path that has been taken before. It was good to see JJ Abrams take on the Star Wars franchise but I missed George Lucas' midas touch that he gave the previous Star Wars movies. John Williams returns as the composer and his musical score gave the movie an energetic feel.There was a large amount of hype surrounding the movie and rightfully so. Most people have raved about how good it was and there is a small minority that dislike the movie. I'm sitting firmly in the category of people who thought it was good but not great. While Star Wars The Force Awakens was worth a watch overall I felt as if it was rehashing old ground with a touch of nostalgia thrown in with the characters from the original movies. But nonetheless, Star Wars: The Force Awakens was a decent time filler.6/10.
ID_100078;10;10;"I know I'm late to the Star Wars party, but there's an old say; better late than never. By now, many of us had seen what Abrams and Disney brought to us to the big screen, as it's currently breaking box office records left and right, and could possibly Avatar for highest grossing domestic film of all time in a matter of days now. It's been 10 years since the last Star Wars film, and boy, it couldn't had come out in a better time. Abrams and Disney bring us Episode 7: The Force Awakens. How good is it?The film takes place 30 years after the events of Return of Jedi. Darth Vader is defeated, and the galaxy is at peace. Until a new threat named Kylo Ren tries to take over the galaxy. He's after a map that could tell us where Luke Skywalker is. Luke has disappeared over the last 30 years and both the First Order and the Resistance and searching for him. The plot is very basic, but definitely does scream Star Wars. Abrams and his other writers did a good job with the plot for the 7th installment in the Star Wars saga, as it continues where we left off, and leaves us wanting more in the end. The plot introduces us to new heroes such as Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac), Finn (John Boyega), and Rey (Daisy Ridley).Now Abrams brought back some of the old characters we loved in the original Star Wars trilogy. Harrison Ford returns as Han Solo, Carrie Fisher returns as Leia, and even Chewbacca returns. Now they're introduced later on in the film, but Han and Chewie gets the most screen time. Now the new characters really carry this film. Poe is a Resistance pilot, Finn is a former Stormtrooper trying to change his ways, and Rey is a scavenger from the planet Jakku, who trades pieces of ships for reward. Of course, there's the little orange and white droid known as the BB-8 who plays as the trusty droid. The film focuses more on Rey and Finn the most as they team up with Han and Chewie in the second act of the film. They all serve the plot well, and the young good actors do a good job at portraying the heroes. Replacing Darth Vader is Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) who joined the Dark Side in a similar fashion as Darth Vader did. Adam Driver does a good job as playing the villainous Kylo Ren as he opposes as a threat to our new heroes in future movies.It's good to see Star Wars back on top. JJ Abrams brings the Star Wars saga back to life. We had to sit through George Lucas' prequel trilogy, but now we have a new trilogy we can enjoy and sit through. The hype was worth the wait, the old characters we all love are back, and the new characters are going to be loved by fans of this franchise. The story is good, and the visual effects are fantastic. It has everything we love about Star Wars, from the opening crawl to the classic John Williams score. I did have some nitpicks here and there. I did felt the second act did drove on for awhile, but that's mild criticism at best. Like Disney did with Marvel, Lucasfilms is in good hands as well, and I'll be looking forward to future Star Wars movies made by Disney. If you haven't check it out already, go check it out immediately. This is one expert if you don't want to miss on the big screen. This gets an easy 10/10 from me."
ID_100079;10;10;Star Wars Episode 7: The Force Awakens was absolutely incredible. The theater experience was the best movie watching experience I have ever endured. It's worth the hype and so much better than the prequels. In fact, it's my favorite Star Wars film. The cast and characters, old and new, are all phenomenal but Daisy Ridley (Rey) stole the show for me. I have fallen in love with Star Wars all over again. Thank you JJ Abrams for a story that will live on for generations to come. Wow! Bring on Episode VIII! The greatest Star Wars movie of all time and the most fun I've ever had in the theater. I just bought it on blu-ray and will enjoy this film for the remainder of my life. Just amazing.
ID_100080;10;10;I don't really understand the negative reviews on here. People moaned that the prequels were nothing like the original trilogy and now they are moaning that this is too similar??? LOL Get a life, children!This was an absolutely wonderful movie. Ever since I was 4 years old I've attended star wars openings. And the force awakens was no different. Was it like the old movies? No, of course not. But it was a new take on an ever expanding universe. Everyone on here throwing up 1 or 2 stars are just butthurt. They complain about Disney or JJ Abrams directing it. But the truth is they did a fantastic job revitalizing an old series. It's our jobs as fans to make it the best series possible, so please for the love of god ignore all of these idiots and see the movie. You will not be disappointed!
ID_100081;6;7;"A fun time at the theatre but not much else. I liked the additions, and how the Force worked, but it was kind of a mess. Weird pacing, hyperactive editing, and plot points straight out copied from A New Hope. Rey was okay, she was overacting at times and her performance felt a bit too artificial, in fact the whole movie felt artificial. The directing was just, too much! Too much intensity, overly polished and produced, out of place crooked camera angles and slow zooms to make everything intense when it's completely unnecessary. Good performances overall, fun action, I was eating my popcorn pretty fast. Well timed fan services and winks to the original trilogy, but when I left the theatre I told myself:""Meh, it was fine."" Better than the prequels obviously, but that is not saying much. They crammed so much in one movie, that the movie itself felt claustrophobic. Kids will LOVE it. I, personally, liked it for what it was, but I was disappointed considering the hype and fantastic reviews. NOT A BAD MOVIE, at all, it's a fairly competent big budget space movie, but not as good as I thought it would be. Haters giving this 1 star are just lying. It is far from a bad movie, there was a lot of love and craftsmanship behind this film and it would never deserve a one star.6.5/10 :-)"
ID_100082;10;10;This movie is amazing, entertaining, and well crafted as a film in general. The movie is incredibly exciting with humor, action, references and the beautifully written plot. There's so much more I could say about this film but I feel like you should watch it for yourself and enjoy it as much as I did. Ignore anyone who gives this a 1/10, there's not liking a film and then there's bitterness. 10/10 summed up the feeling I had before, during and after watching. It's an absolute masterpiece in every area across the board. End of story.
ID_100083;6;3;"Why did I entitled the review this way? Because if I was George Lucas... this is what I would've said at the premiere of this film. Sad...I am a fan since I was a kid. I used to sneak in the cinemas to see the first 2 episodes over and over again. We used to fight with sticks that in our minds were shiny lightsabers. We grew up and we loved every episode that came out... but this one... It's a disappointment for me.I will have to say that I admire the acting and all the technology that went into it, the cast and crew and that it really hurts me to give it such a rate.I'll spell it in bullet points why and I will do my best to avoid spoilers.So: 1. They timed the episode so they can sync it to the age of the old cast to they can bring them back. Nothing wrong in that. I even liked it. It was really good to see the iconic faces. But what they did to the characters... I'll let you judge.2. I could smell the plot from a mile. Why? Because it wasn't something to keep you guessing all the way.3. The movie was focus on making a huge hype to people break the box office, not on carrying the story and the legendary characters, telling a series of exciting tales.4. Lots of scenes were done just to bring back memories as they were almost cloned from the older episodes... seriously. Watch carefully and you tell me if I'm right.5. I tried to understand who's the main character in this one and honestly they did a great job in confusing me. I did figure it out, but the fog they spread over the story made it so hard to identify who I should follow and relate and even care about.6. The shaking of a particular character made me single him out way before the reveal and his implication into the story... which started pretty slow.7. A lot of the Star Wars characters are missing... and honestly... I was hoping to bring them back at least for some moments... even in a flashback.8. The lightsaber fights are not spectacular at all. It's almost like watching a Medieval show or some Comic Con fans having fulling around.9. Someone is using the lightsaber like (he/she) had 7 lives to learn all that. I remember the tough times Like and the others had to go through to master the weapon and the other Jedi abilities.10. Someone is becoming a Jedi just by thinking is one. Again... I don't want to push spoilers on you, but it's happening. I hope you catch the moment.11. There is another reveal in the film that is totally ordinary. They are trying to build the moment... but it's too short and way too slim because we don't know the story behind the character and we didn't see anything epic happening to it to come to the situation he is in at the moment.12. The ending... no comment. I don't want to say too much because I don't want to spoil it. Slow and way too ""epic"" for what it is. I was expecting something to finish the film to lead you into the other one... because you know that will start producing them on a conveyor belt once Disney put their hands on it.I'll stop here... there's a lot to talk about but I am sure a bunch of YouTUBErs jumped on it already.So... again. Disappointing. And I am disappointed that I am disappointed. Even worse.As I said: I bet George Lucas was saying ""No no no no no no..."" in his mind when he watched it."
ID_100084;5;5;So, to start, I'm not a big Star Wars movies fan. I like the Star Wars universe and like Star Wars: KOTOR games. I've watched all movies though.I was actually really excited because I believed that with a new Director and freedom from Disney to do whatever (changing the original story), they would make a great and interesting film, but...It begins with new characters and starts off real well. But after a while, it's just the same old non-interesting story, but this time with terrible antagonists (not going to spoil anything). It's almost like watching episode IV all over again but with recent effects and new characters. They forced it too much to be like episode IV, V and VI, and the result is something terrible.There are a few funny scenes or characters everyone talks about through internet memes, etc. but the movie in general is uninteresting and even tedious.
ID_100086;10;10;"This new edition to the Star Wars franchise is arguably the best by  far. It combines the time-tested formula with the new and raw ideas  Disney brings to the table. From the moment the traditional text crawl  appears, this movie will keep you at the edge of your seat serving you  with action-packed scenes and unpredictable reveals that will surely  make you wanting for more.  One thing I particularly adored is how this new movie creativity uses  the Force. Disney has steered away from the boring 'push and pull'  concept and found ways you could never imagine the Force can be applied  and used on.  The presence of the old cast was monumental as it helped the old  audience transition to the new heroes  as they have similar (but also  diverse) qualities with their old counterparts. The ending, as  expected, is a major cliff-hanger. Expect to walk out of the cinema  dazed, amazed and confused as the movie, not only, answer the old  questions, but at the same time unfold new mysteries for the audience  to ponder on. Star Wars: The Force Awakens is a movie this generation  should really see. I genuinely recommend you see it on IMAX so you may  experience the Force in a way that will leave you lost in thought in  the days to come.  You-are-wel-come"
ID_100087;10;10;Let me just say that this film was sensational!To begin, the storyline is original and captivating. The acting from the newbies (Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, Oscar Isaac) is excellent. The acting from the old heroes was also incredible - Harrison Ford is back as Han Solo and Carrie Fisher is back as General Leia Organa, and they are better than ever! The villains are great too (Adam Driver as Kylo Ren) is great! The visuals - especially in IMAX 3D -- quite frankly blew my mind. Nothing looked overly fake like in the prequel trilogy - you really felt like you were part of the movie. The combination of practical and visual effects was brilliant! Another thing about this film, which you typically don't have in Star Wars films (especially the prequels) is humour - and The Force Awakens has plenty and it hits HARD!! And of course, the movie has many emotional moments, yes - I cried at some parts, and the pure nostalgia of it worked beautifully made it so much better! The final shot of the film was not just the best final shot of a Star Wars film - but one of (if not THE) best final shots of any film in cinematic history.Overall, Star Wars: The Force Awakens is more than I expected: it has the perfect blend of action, adventure, humour, some hints of romance, and emotion. By far the best film of 2015, the best Star Wars film, and one of the best movies of all time. Thank you JJ, we trusted you, and you delivered! Cannot wait for Episode 8!
ID_100088;8;8;"In general, I was satisfied with the viewing. The main thing that I liked was how the film was shot. First, the creators as much as possible embodied in it a visual image from old movies. Secondly, there were many actors and favorite characters from the old ""Star Wars"". Thirdly, the film has comical moments that fans of this space saga will certainly appreciate. Well, of course, a lot of shooting both on land and in space. In general, the continuation was possible, as an integral part of previous films. The film is quite dynamic and spectacular. I can not call it the best if compared with the rest of the ""Star Wars"", it can't be called the best.I was pleased with the schedule, and humor added its zest. The only thing that can be attributed to the shortcomings of the film is the absence of a pronounced story line. Of course, the plot is there, but it's some kind of blurry. I recommend watching this movie, but do not expect anything supernatural from him."
ID_100089;6;8;Star Wars: The Force AwakensDespite its liberation years ago, the Galaxy is once more under the control of a new Sith Lord: Darth Disney.And while the Dark Mouse doesn't make an appearance in this sci-fi movie, his presence is felt.A forager, Rey (Daisy Ridley), befriends a droid transporting the whereabouts of the last Jedi (Mark Hamill) to the resistance General (Carrie Fisher). But an overzealous member of The First Order (Adam Driver) wants the droid too, so Rey must flee with help from an ex-stormtrooper (John Boyega). Later, they align themselves with a grizzled smuggler (Harrison Ford) with knowledge of Rey's newfound abilities.With stunning effects and organic worlds, Disney's continuation returns the franchise back to basics. Unfortunately, that also includes familiar menaces, similar plot points and a plagiaristic ending. Not to mention a petulant child posturing as the villain. Furthermore, where does Disney get off not including any sing-along kids songs? Yellow Lightvidiotreviews.blogspot.ca
ID_100090;10;10;I saw Star Wars in 1977 and since then I have seen all the episodes multiple times. The Force Awakens is one of the best entries in the series if not the best one yet. I do not understand any negative reviews, especially by the so-called original fans. This movie is awesome and outstanding. Kylo Ren is the best Star Wars villain yet. The young actors are by far better than Hamill, Ford and Fisher were in 1977. Especially Daisy Ridley, who does a very good and convincing job. By the way, the movie is meant to entertain and that is what it does to PERFECTION. 10/10 with ease!
ID_100091;10;10;Great story and action. Even an emotional twist. Character's even better than the New Hope. JJ did it right. Absolute entertainment is what this episode has. I suggest go to Disney x and complete the marathon before #9.
ID_100092;6;6;I knew going in to this film that it wasn't going to be as good as the first two films. Still, I did have high expectations for this film that unfortunately feel flat. This film seems like the first three films thrown together in a blender. With the all the similarities, I was surprised there were no ewoks in the film. Aside from the plot, I felt like the old characters were given too much screen time. While I do love Harrison Ford (My favorite actor), I feel that a lot of the time he doesn't fit into the plot. His relationship with Leia seems forced. These old characters overshadow the potential of Rey and Finn. I like the two new main characters along with Poe who is great in the film. But, this overshadowing wasn't just during the film. Mark Hamill was SECOND BILLED in the credits and didn't have a SINGLE line! He was more important in Kingsman as Professor Arnold than he was in his signature film series. The one thing that saved this film was the action. It may have been michael bay- esque, but at least it was awesome. Episode IV and V in my opinion are 10/10 movies, but this film just didn't cut it. I'm not that big of a star wars fans as I haven't seen the prequel movies, but I know this one seemed like a Brady Bunch reunion. 6/10
ID_100093;10;10;"A perfectly balanced blend of charming love-letter to the style and structure of the original trilogy, infused with an emphatic freshness of humour and new ideas, creates what could be argued to be the purest straight Star Wars film of the entire saga. Paced to perfection as it hits the familiar narrative beats we come to expect, Awakens is alive with the over-the-top action and stirring sentimentality of the films we grew up with while also casting very modern shadow of intrigue and mystery that sets the mind whirring with possibilities as the story moves forward; a shot of pure adrenaline to the heart of the Star Wars fan in all of us that had laid dormant for ten years since Lucas completed his prequel trilogy."
ID_100095;8;9;Abrams had the benefit of learning what didn't work in Lucas' prequels, and he's gone in the opposite direction. He's also set an interesting course for moving forward with this engaging cast playing new characters making their way through this beloved universe.
ID_100096;8;9;It's over 30 years since the defeat of the empire. The Republic is threatened by the First Order led by Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) under the control of Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis). The resistance led by General Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher) is fighting the Dark Side. Finn (John Boyega) is a conflicted stormtrooper. Rey (Daisy Ridley) is a scavenger on the planet Jakku. Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) is the Resistance ace pilot.It has been over 30 years since the last truly good Star Wars movie. It is a great reboot and a solid repair job to the damage from the prequels. The biggest complaint seems to be that this is a repeat of A New Hope. If anything, this is pulling out scenes and references from all three originals. I have no problems with that. In fact, it's good to go back and take pages out of the original trilogy. Even the force is explained more in the traditional way. However, this is not a simple repeat. The new characters are tremendous. John Boyega and Daisy Ridley are amazing additions. He's an interesting character and I love their initial meeting. I love him keep grabbing her hand. There are some minor problems but they're too minor to mention especially considering the spoilers. I rank 'The Empire Strikes Back' (1980) the best, 'A New Hope' (1977) second, and I may squeeze 'The Force Awakens' slightly ahead of 'Return of the Jedi' (1983). Forget the prequels.P.S. In this one, nobody loses a lightsaber fight because of elevation.
ID_100097;8;8;Another decade has past and J.J. Abrams, resurrector of franchises, has come to take his swing at bringing back a sense of movie magic to Star Wars. Did he succeed? I don't know yet. It's hard to judge such a hyped movie after a first viewing and this one leaves me with mixed, but positive feelings after watching it.I liked the new characters introduced in the movie and their acting was great (especially compared to the returning stars) and this fact leaves me with a lot of hope for the upcoming episodes. The movie also had a real sense of 'fun' to it which is good. Even if it's a dark subject matter at times it's also a fantastical and for many people uplifting story at the core of it. Sometimes I felt it was a bit too much fun but this is one of the things that will probably settle with further viewings.Onto the things I did not like as much. I thought the movie lost some of it's pacing a bit into the story. This might have had something to do with the weight all the intertwined characters and personal developments placed on the movie, I think that was the case at least, but this is also something I think will improve in the upcoming movies.In the end it's the Star Wars we probably needed right now. It's nowhere near the originals, but it's also light years from the prequels, and it sets us off on a journey towards a greater saga in episode eight and nine as well as within the extended universe.
ID_100098;10;10;"Star Wars: The Force Awakens is a fabulous film and is a good dose of escapism from mundane everyday life, just like The Original Trilogy was. We can forget all our problems when seeing this movie. The Force Awakens sparks a joy for the child in all of us which many of us have been waiting for since The Empire strikes Back or Return of the Jedi. There couldn't have been a story more worthy of the subtitle 'Episode VII'.After the whole Trade Negotiations rubbish that plagued the Star Wars Prequel Trilogy. J.J. Abrams reinvigorates the assaulted franchise and gives us some of the most powerful moments ever seen in the saga.Don't give in to the trolling of the prequel or original trilogy fanboys. They're just upset that somebody did a much stronger job than Lucas could have managed on his own. They couldn't tell a good movie apart from Transformers 3 & 4, or any Michael Bay movie for that matter. We are entitled to our own opinion and mustn't succumb to these 'emotion vampires' that do their best and ultimately fail to make a difference in the end.The Force Awakens is a refreshingly fun film that as a form of escape in this day and age plagued by terrorism, cyber-terrorism, LGBT discrimination and racism. Star Wars is a welcoming series that isn't conformed by anything in our world ; it's a self-realising ecstasy that will always be there for us like an old friend. 10 stars"
ID_100099;6;6;"Basically adequate reboot of this legendary film series offers up a reasonably entertaining story, but one without much resonance. The special effects often tend to take over, and there's not really that much threat from the villains on hand. While it is a treat to see veterans of the franchise return to their beloved roles, they mostly take a back seat to the new characters. Yes, the yarn concocted here by director J.J. Abrams and original series screenwriter Lawrence Kasdan feels awfully familiar at times; there's no denying that. ""The Force Awakens"" also tends to get a little overly precious, as it concerns the new droid character BB-8.30 years after the Rebels helped to eliminate the Empire and destroy their second Death Star, a new evil entity has emerged to take the Empires' place. They're the ""First Order"", and one of their number is a moody young Jedi named Kylo Ren (Adam Driver). Not helping matters is the fact that original hero Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) has disappeared at this time when he's needed the most. The Rebels are now re-christened The Resistance, and Leia, now a general with this organization, seeks to find her missing brother. Drawn into the fray are Finn (John Boyega of ""Attack the Block""), a former Stormtrooper who experienced a change of heart, and Rey (Daisy Ridley), a desert scavenger.""The Force Awakens"" yields adequate entertainment, and attempts to deliver some genuine emotion, but it fails to be completely engaging. It's got a breathless pace to it, and lots of action. The cast features a number of familiar faces, but they've been better utilized in other things. Harrison Fords' Han Solo, who's gone back to his mercenary ways, gets the lions' share of screen time compared to his fellow alumni of Episodes IV to VI. He, at least, is in fine form. But Kylo Ren is an underwhelming villain, as is the all-powerful figure Snoke from whom he takes his orders. He's a pipsqueak compared to Darth Vader. It's also a real shame to have the legendary Max von Sydow on hand in the opening minutes, in such a regrettably brief cameo appearance. Fortunately, Boyega and Ridley are appealing heroes and anchor this stage of the saga pretty well. And the expected abundance of CGI is complemented by a respectable amount of practical effects.Overall, a well intentioned but uninspired continuation of Episodes I to VI.Six out of 10."
ID_100100;8;8;"I previously wrote a scathing review of this film and gave it 3 stars. I now have to give it 8 for the music alone. The music is a ""10"" but the film is a ""3"". Let me explain.You would think that in this day and age that music would be electronic and automated. Last night, my wife attended a performance of the Santa Barbara Symphony where they ended with music from the original Star Wars (what my kids know as Episode 4). The conductor congratulated the musicians from that orchestra who made the music for this film! It was about half the orchestra that had been in the orchestra for the latest Star Wars movie!The music was entirely acoustic! That is to say, all the instruments of the orchestra were non- electronic instruments played by real people. You have to admit the music is fantastic. The conductor of the Santa Barbara Symphony pointed out that these were some of the most heard musicians on stage. Full disclosure: I am a professional musician myself with a degree from one of the great music schools (I play the pipe organ).While I was not impressed by the plot nor the visual effects, the music makes this film worthwhile."
ID_100101;10;10;A fun romp that holds true to the wit, adventure, and visual spectacle of the original trilogy. The sights, sounds, and feel hearkens back to when this franchise knew what it was doing. I look forward to many more viewings and the follow-on films to come.
ID_100102;8;10;"The fate of a foot soldier, an ageing pirate (and his loyal sidekick), a young girl, a star pilot and the leader of an enemy army, all collide and intertwine in this highly anticipated return of the Star Wars series.It was with apprehension that I approached The Force Awakens. Having invested a great deal of expectation and anticipation into the prequels during my formative adult years, I approached TFA with a sense of withdrawal. This stemmed from the fear I have that any amount of hype would eventually just leave me in another state of devastation and possible resignation to the knowledge that our heroes (George Lucas, I'm looking at you) will always remain all too human, a state which I have never quite recovered from. Well TFA has somehow restored my faith in movie-making, and possibly in life itself, from the first moment when the words ""A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away"" appeared, to the second when the ubiquitous blue credits started rolling at the end. For the whole duration I was taken back to my youth, more specifically, the heady days of the early nineties, not to a time when I yearned for adventure and sought mystical powers to defeat my enemies, but to a time when all that I demanded from certain sci-fi adventure movies was that they were as good as Star Wars.TFA is most certainly a movie that can stand quite proudly amongst the original trilogy. J.J Abrams vision shows a director who has a deft eye for the spectacular whilst equally comfortable paying homage to his predecessors. A good clue to this movies retro roots is in the title itself, ""The Force Awakens"", the director J.J Abrams definitely reclaims the power and mysticism of 'the force'. In the prequels ""the force"" became a throwaway trope, everybody had the force in the prequels and it was used so flagrantly that we forgot it's true intangible qualities. In TFA, as the name suggests 'the force' is used sparingly, but to great effect (there was one particular scene where I had to fight the urge to applaud in the cinema). J.J Abrams clearly understands the text that he has be given along with it's wider fandom, and rather than shrink, he has rose to the occasion and brought us something great, spectacular and touching epochal.In terms of story telling, the characters of Rey and Finn carry the lions share of the plot, whilst characters such as Han Solo, Chewbacca and Princess Leia return to add some much appreciated gravitas to proceedings. Also there should be a mention for the actor Adam Driver playing the latest antagonist Kylo Renn. Driver plays this role well and is convincing in his troubled persona, appearing evil yet at the same time angst ridden. In previous instalments both Anakin Skywalker and Darth Vader carried this duality inside of them, but Kylo Renn truly embodies this fear (and rage) as an integral part of his character. Through his portrayal of Kylo Renn, Driver elevates what could have so easily been a poor mans Darth Vader to a character that is fresh and suitably imperious.Now to address some of the criticisms directed at the movie. Some may argue that rather than paying homage TFA is in effect a reboot/re-telling of the original trilogy, twists and turn and all, WITH the inclusion of a Death Star and a masked villain who has more than a passing resemblance to Darth Vader. You could even go further and say that whole characters along with their personality traits have been cut and pasted from the original trilogy and plonked square onto a whole host of characters in TFA. Whilst this is undeniable and some might argue all too obvious, the only defence that I can give to this is that TFA is the first of a new trilogy. The faint whiff of a movie making process that is hedging it's bets on how to develop it's character, and what direction to take it in, has not quite come about fully formed.To take it to another discussion I think Hollywood has learnt that introducing new characters to a well known and beloved movie series (I hate the term franchise) can be a precarious one, Jar Jar Binks being the go to model of new characters that did not quite resonate with an audience. So it is very likely that the writers erred on the side of caution and made certain characters from TFA a composite of what was great about previous characters in the original/prequels. Is it noticeable, yes, is it enough to distract and cause this audience member to cry foul, no.Ultimately, once all the analysis has been done, The Force Awaken succeeds in reinvigorating and restoring the lustre of the original trilogy. A lustre that had been besmirched by the god awful George Lucas prequels. It has been noted by many commentators that the prequel trilogy was too explanatory, telling the story in a way which was both lacking in subtlety, yet somehow at the same time convoluted and bogged down in some civil war/trade politics that nobody could quite explain nor care for. The Force Awakens dispenses with all the faux political subtexts that effectively ruined the prequels and takes the story back to the heart of the original trilogy. That heart being the story of an everyday young hero longing for adventure, who is then taken on a fantastical journey and on the way meet an unlikely crew of bandits and mis-fit companions. Eventually said hero discovers that their life not only has a higher purpose, but that greatness is, and always has been inherent within them. It's a story as old as story telling itself, but when done right, it hits the mark every time."
ID_100103;8;10;For many years that you have been aching for a good massage. You have been to Thailand many years back and had an excellent massage by the sea. The masseuse applied strange techniques, and you wondered she knew what she was doing. But as her finger touched your upper back, you cried. You cried with joy. It was a feeling like never before. It was something that you could never forget. And in your trip, you went for massage three times, till each muscle in your body and brain was filled with nostalgia.You tried getting the same feeling again at your local massage parlor. You tried three times, but all you got was disappointment, regret and more craving to visit Thailand again.Now you learned about opening of a new Thai massage parlor in your town. You are strangely excited, though also scared if it will be again a disappointment like the last three times. But you wait. You watch the shop getting setup with anticipation. You read their brochure - with staff from Thailand. Your hopes go up. On the day of opening you go there to have another full body massage.And from the first touch you know it's not like the last three times. It's different. It's like the original massage of the Thailand. It uses same everything. The steps of the massage, the scent of the room, even the masseuse looks the same(and then you remember it's racist to think all Asians looks the same).You tell the masseuse to do you more on the upper back and shoulders, but then you realizes that she doesn't speak English. You tell yourself that it's OK. Your muscles are still touched. Then she goes to your calves and pinch it like squeezing lemon. You remember that you didn't like it first time but it's not something that need to be repeated. But of course, you can't tell your masseuse. You fall into sleep while she's rubbing your head and you ponder about the new Star War movie you just saw.It got rid of all the bad things in the prequels (i.e. writer and director George Lucas) So you don't have bad dialogs, cardboard characters and dull acting. The fight scenes look real and there are people in the movie you care about. It's really good start to a new trilogy (or quadrilogy, depending on the studious decision to split last movie into two) The actors have acted very well an there are character arcs, which make the conflict so much engaging. There are cool fight scenes and some funny dialogs. It's like the director listened to every complain people had from the prequels and tried to fix it this time, which resulted in a really great movie.You wake up from your sleep. The massage is now over. You pay the fee and give some more money as tip. You walk out of the parlor feeling great. And as you walk, it comes to you that this massage was too similar to the massage you had in Thailand. It would have been better if they could have got rid of the calf squeezing thing, it doesn't work every time. Also, there were lot of things that didn't make sense. Why did she twisted your earlobes? There is no tension in earlobes to relieve. It took you only ten seconds to walk from counter to cabin, but when the masseuse went to get oil, it took her ten minutes. Lot more things come to your mind, but then you tell yourself that you enjoyed the massage, all these things doesn't matter. You think about your next trip to the parlor and feel excited.
ID_100104;10;10;"JJ Abrahams has directed a fine Star Wars movie with numerous hidden references and Easter eggs which are pretty mind blowing once they are found out. Many fans keep complaining how the plot is similar to ""A New Hope"". However, a saga prominent as this one must recapture what was observed more than 3 decades ago to show obvious relevance to the past."
ID_100105;7;7;My review of this entry is simple, it is a New Hope redone with new characters and a couple of different twists. Does this make it bad? No. There is no such thing as a bad Star Wars film. The problem with the lifelong fans, of which I am, I was four when A New Hope was released, is that they want to recapture the awe and splendor that they experienced when Star Wars first came out. It will never happen people.
ID_100106;9;9;This is so easily the overall best movie in the Star Wars franchise it's not even remotely up for debate (with The Last Jedi an incredibly close second!) Great story, excellent acting, brilliant action, etc etc etc etc.The cinematography was sweeping and excellent. The characters were imaginative and fresh. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and would watch it again without hesitation. The plot was easily the best of the entire series and the cast were all outstanding in their parts as well.Can't wait for yet another 12 out 10 masterpiece with Episode 9, once again directed by THE KING!

yes it's similar to a new hope but it's not a remake of it because the characters and story its different, it's what this franchise needed the fans wanted a classic simple star wars and jj did just that and much more.the only two negatives i have is that it there is another death star again... and carrie fishers acting other than that it's a pretty decent star wars movie."
ID_100109;8;8;"The Force Awakens is fun and action-packed, if derivative, entertainment. It pays several homages to the original trilogy and introduces new characters, most of which are interesting. The story, as many have mentioned, is a rehash of Ep. IV, V, VI, to varying degrees, but I won't be stressing on that in this review since it's been validly stressed upon already. The CGI of course is great, and while it isn't used to add any new landscapes or settings, it does justice to the pre-established worlds of star wars. The background score is competent. I believe the acting has never been a forte of the Star Wars trilogy. Barring, Luke Skywalker there isn't really much in the way of brilliant 'acting' as opposed to mere 'reacting' to various situations and dangers. This is not to say that Darth Vader wasn't a villain of epic proportions, nor does it take away anything from the charismatic hero that was Han Solo, the only point being, that these characters were brought to life by brilliantly engaging story arcs, intelligent dialogue and individual peculiarities; Darth Vader's ominous voice, and Han Solo's rebellious charm. Yet, these have less to do with the more conventional sense of great acting; in the potent expression of emotions and thoughts, as wide as they may be. Heath Ledger's terrific performance in The Dark Knight is universally lauded, just as Jack Nicholson's in The Shining; that is the acting that levels great. And that is why, the acting in TFA does not specifically surprise me, it is only more of the same. The acting is good enough to serve the purpose. I don't think anyone has to be convinced to watch this movie, because all nostalgic fans of old will definitely flock to the theatre to relive their childhoods and younger generations will be attracted to this simply due to the overwhelming hype around the film, so instead of writing a review of why one should or shouldn't watch this film, I'd rather discuss what this film IS. I believe this movie is the bait, by which Disney is sizing up the audience that will stay loyal to it in the sequels sure to come. It adopts the role of passing on the baton, so to speak. Eclipsing the prequels, this movie is the first real visit to Star Wars in over 30 years and hence admittedly, there must be adequate portions of remembrance both in visuals and in sentiment, of what made the first trilogy so great while pleasantly setting up new story arcs and characters. This movie gives us a taste of the breadth of stories and character arcs that are inevitable in the movies to come. SPOILERS SPOILERS- I say this because the movie does not really have any exposition for particulars like- WHAT happened to the happy ending that was 'Return of the Jedi'? HOW and when did the 'First Order' come into existence? WHAT were the circumstances under which Rey was left abandoned on a desert planet? WHAT specifically led to Kylo Ren being seduced by the Dark side? WHY does the map to Luke even exist, if his location was after all supposed to be undisclosed?? WHAT Force after all, has been awakened?WHY did a hibernating R2D2 suddenly spring to life and save the day after years of being inactive? HOW did Rey, while being prisoner at Kylo's ship brainwash a guard to set her free, without the least bit of training? And for that matter, why would Kylo leave a single guard to watch over his most valued prisoner, and also, after she is set free, how is it that the stormtroopers are unable to locate her via cameras aboard the ship? Do they really NOT have any cameras on board despite all the amazing technology they have? HOW is Rey able to battle and defeat a Sith Lord mere hours after learning that she might have the Force within her?It is questions such as these, that are left unanswered, and while it does provide much fodder for the sequels, it leaves the movie itself achingly short of depth and clarity. END OF SPOILERKylo Ren was an intriguing villain upto the point at which he takes off his mask for no real reason. Finn was occasionally funny but not too real. Poe seemed like a great lead character but he was under used. Han Solo was good. Rey, however was the best of the crew in that she seemed to have an interesting backstory while also playing an important role in the progression of the movie itself. The action sequences are reminiscent of the those from the OT, and are well done. All in all, TFA is great nostalgia-fun for hardcore fans and laidback-fun for the rest. If only it brought some closure to even a couple of the questions that it leaves unanswered, it would have benefited gravely. And had it dared to venture new plot lines, of course."
ID_100111;6;9;"As we know Disney has bought the rights for the all next Star Wars films. The moment was right, the comic book movies are on top of the production and is expected to decline.

After so much time you got enough from this franchise. And if somebody gets to you with the money, You would not think twice. The same thing is with George Lucas. I do not wanna compare me with him but....The money has to be recovered and it is a huge amount of money. It is an investment of at least of following 12-15 years.Disney simply thought to copy the episode IV and to make a fresh start for the next generations. Sorry but we are old (44 years), yes and got the kid from my own. The story is the same as the episodes IV with the some old and the new characters, and is located some 30 years later in the future.But has anybody ever seen in the last 20 years a really good movie from Disney, not counting animation films???Easy answer. Nobody ! So, what did you expect???This is a simple answer to why the film has failed. Other people have already written in their reviews more about other stuff, so I do not want repeat all of it."
ID_100112;2;9;"Did the world really need ANOTHER Star Wars movie? It depends on who you ask. Star Wars junkies don't count as they're a notoriously biased and juvenile bunch and obviously they can't get enough of all things star wars, no matter how bad or unnecessary they may be. To everybody else, like me, the answer is NO.This movie is totally unnecessary and adds absolutely nothing to the Star Wars saga. To make matters worse, it's boring, predictable and simply juvenile. There's nothing original, good or memorable about it, other than the star wars label that attracts so much media attention and, therefore, sells so well. Harrison Ford looked jaded, bored and generally unconvincing. Everybody else was mediocre at best. The special effects are good, but if all a movie has going for it are special effects and no substance, then, no matter how ""prestigious"" the title and its history, one can't help but go away empty-handed and express a negative opinion. I've never been a star wars fan but I still went to see the movie with an open mind expecting to see, at least, a decent movie. As the clock ticked, though, I just got more and more bored, frustrated and disappointed. When I left the theater, I felt screwed by the Hollywood propaganda machine and by all the fake positive reviews I've read over the past few days pretty much everywhere. Rest assured this will be the first and last Star Wars movie I've ever paid to see.Do yourself a favor: if you want to see a truly memorable, meaningful movie, check out ""Bridge of Spies"" by Steven Spielberg."
ID_100113;8;9;Taking the first Star Wars with a fresh twist, it contains many subtle elements that tie in with the original film. Yet, this film is basically a repeat of the last, just with some fresh faces. That is not necessarily a bad thing however. It's a winning formula. For the fans, you'll absolutely love it.However, for the newbies, I highly recommend that this not be the first film you watch if you're trying to dip your toes into the whole saga(aka me but bad idea, trust me). With too many insider 'jokes' of sorts, there's much that would unfortunately not be appreciated if you started here. The Mandalorian is significantly easier to stomach in that sense.
ID_100114;10;5;"Its finally here. After Disney's $4 Billion acquisition of Lucasfilm back in 2012, the announcement that there would be a sequel trilogy beginning with a 7th episode in the beloved franchise was met with intrigue and excitement by fans everywhere. I am a longtime fan of the saga(both the originals and prequels to a degree); and I have spent countless dollars on games(most recently Star Wars Battlefront) , books, and tuned in to the cartoon Star Wars: The Clone Wars and Star wars rebels from time to time.This review will be lengthy, but there is so much to say about Star Wars: The Force Awakens.Starting with the actors, Star Wars The Force Awakens has a star-studded cast. John Boyega, who I have followed since his role in the film Attack the Block, stars as Finn alongside actress Daisy Ridley who plays Rey. They are very likable as the main protagonists, with Finn wanting to leave his life behind as a stormtrooper and Rey being a self-reliant person from the planet Jakku. I also very much enjoyed Oscar Isaac's role as X-Wing pilot Poe Dameron; and I hope we see more of his character in the future Star Wars films. It was nice to see the return of characters like Chewbacca, Carrie Fisher's Princess Leia, and seeing Harrison Ford make his return as Han Solo garnered a round of applause from the audience and myself. Andy Serkis stars as Supreme Leader Snoke and does a nice job, while Gwendoline Christie portrays Captain Phasma. Domhnall Gleeson makes his character General Hux a memorably vocal antagonist. But perhaps most satisfying of all the characters is Adam Driver's Kylo Ren. My friends and I discussed Star Wars: The Force Awakens well before its release, and though our opinions differed, we all agreed that the movie absolutely needed a imposing and memorable villain. And Kylo Ren is just that. I enjoyed how much Star Wars: The Force Awakens explored Kylo's persona and duality; while at the same time giving explanation as to how he came to be just who he is.The story in Star Wars: The Force Awakens adds new elements but has constant reminders that will delight Star Wars fans(as they did me) of why they are fans of the popular space opera in the first place. JJ Abrams incorporates humour into Star Wars: The Force Awakens, but it works very well. And there are numerous surprises , and some moments that hit your emotional side.And even better, the action scenes in the movie are absolutely wonderful. The lightsaber battles are noticeably different here than previous films, and the familiar theme music that we all know and love will definitely be heard in Star Wars: The Force Awakens. Taking over the directorial duties for a Star Wars film is no easy task, but JJ Abrams has done an impressive job creating this film.I'd like to point out that the ONLY problem I had with Star Wars: The Force Awakens is that there were certain characters I would have like to have seen have more screen time. But even still, Star Wars: The Force Awakens delivers spectacle, and wonder thanks to the talented cast, the direction of JJ Abrams, and the likable combination of old/new elements to the I sincerely hope everyone enjoys Star Wars: The Force Awakens as much as I did. Star Wars: The Force Awakens is a nice reminder that this is why we go to the movies. And truthfully, I am excited to see where the franchise goes next."
ID_100116;7;9;I spent last half an hour reading first few dozens of reviews on IMDb. Every single one was bashing with rate from 1/10 (big majority) to maximum 4/10. Still, average rating on that same IMDb is 8,1. Conclusion - movie is not at all that bad as they wanna show it. Haters are minority, but all haters have unbearable urge to bash everything they lay their eyes on, while the rest of us who liked the movie and who are in huge majority, mostly do not care to write reviews. To be completely honest, most of their arguments against this movie are hard as a rock, it's all facts, but the final result is not bad movie at all. Haters claim this is is plagiarism of original trilogy. True, movie has one of the most appalling lack of originality I have ever seen, but I prefer to consider it reboot of the original trilogy rather than plagiarism. Yes, they made it to get some more money on old fame and, yes, everything in it we saw before, but still it is nicely done and very entertaining movie. Maybe I fell on targeted nostalgia they cunningly used, but I really really enjoyed this show from the beginning to the very end. I simply loved it.7,5/10

The entire internet is now nothing but spam bots and sell-outs praising an Episode 4 raping better titled as ""A New Hype"".This will go down as the worst Stars Wars until 8 and 9 come out. I remember when TPM came out people were crying--literally full-on tear-streaming--and that had Liam Neeson, Ewan McGregor, and Darth Maul. This movie stars random unknowns confused about whether they are on stage doing a play (white girl, Ridley) or a Nickelodeon comedy-skit (black guy, Boyega).Spoiler Free Breakdown on the Suck-age:1 - No cool villains at all: only STUPID INCOMPETENT Disney villains. 2 - No heroes: only ultra lucky/randomly successful Disney bumblers. 3 - No story from Ep 6: it's like Vader/Luke/Han retired of old age after Ep 5 and The Emperor is just still around but he got senile and really stupid-looking. 4 - No writing: Everything randomly happens and appears. The characters even have jokes about it. 5 - No more Sci-Fi: Nothing makes even George-Lucas sense. Pointless machines (one the size of a planet), no advancement in technology. No A-wings, B-wings, Y-wings, freighters, command ships, or cool looking shuttles. If anything they went backwards from Ep 5, not forward 30 years from Ep 6. 6 - Original trio never on screen together: Not even 1 second or a worthy flashback. No one even knows them as a trio. It's like Episodes 4-6 were just a completely dried-out/stale inside joke between granny Leia and Han. 7 - The Force doesn't make any sense: Doesn't work like any of the other movies. Apparently it now just randomly makes you win or lose--nothing to train or study. Sometimes you have it, other times you don't.8 - Lots of poor CGI: THEY LIED. 9 - The worst lightsabre battles of the series: Prepare for blurry/eye-hurting jump-cuts slapped together. 10 - Stormtroopers aren't elite--in fact they aren't even soldiers anymore: Many of them now spend their time doing random chores you thought the Navy peons or a captured slave or droid would do.It was so bad it would have been better if Lucas remade Howard the Duck starring Jar Jar--literally. I came out of the theatre wishing the movie had starred/dir. by Kevin Smith and was called The Revenge of Cockknocker.Cockknocker is levels cooler than everything in this movie put together--and I hate Kevin Smith and that movie (Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back).At this point, only a full retcon like Wolverine: Origins (an ironically vastly-superior movie compared to this Jar Jar Abrams turd) can resurrect the franchise.Star Wars is DEAD."
ID_100118;9;10;The return of Star Wars has been long-awaited, and it's finally here. With so much hype surrounding the film, there was no-doubt some extreme nervousness about the turnout of the film. But put your nerves at ease, because J.J. and his team have delivered very solid, flawed, but exciting Sci-Fi adventure.There are many aspects to consider when critiquing this film: humour, story, performances, characters and technical achievements - which pinpoint the film's highs and lows.There is a surprising amount of humour in Episode VII. Each character, both old and new, appear to have a comic value of some degree. Han Solo and Chewbacca are their usual gimmicky, humorous selves. The charisma of our new little droid, BB-8 also adds to the fun energy of the movie. Some may argue that there is too much humour in this film to take seriously. Personally, I found it only added to the quality of the film, after all, what is Star Wars without humour? J.J. and Lawrence have done a fantastic job writing the movie. The story is refreshing, with plenty of nostalgic moments (and unfortunately some cliché ones too). The premise of The Force Awakens is definitely one of the most intriguing aspects of the film. After the crawl fades, the action begins, and it doesn't let down! We are greeted to all of the new characters in their seemingly inter-connected lives. We get a bit of an insight into their current lifestyles, motivations and even some of their ambitions. The plot is so event-focused that it demands total awareness and perhaps even repeat viewings. In my opinion, I feel there has been a little too much crammed in to this movie at once, however the unfolding events appear to be leading into what will hopefully be a very exciting sequel.Episode VII introduces many new characters, from Finn and Rey to Poe and Kylo Ren. It's so refreshing and exciting to see the new replace the old, as our next chapter in the Star Wars saga begins. Performance wise, all actors portray their characters well. It's honestly nothing spectacular, but it appears each actor is well invested in their character. Although something to note are our new leads, played by John Boyega (Finn) and Daisy Ridley (Rey). Both present us with fairly simple characters, experiencing a sudden turn in their casual lives. This is quite reminiscent of many characters from this film's predecessors. We'll also be looking forwards to Adam Driver in future, who plays the menacing and somewhat awkward character of Kylo Ren.In technical aspects, The Force Awakens holds up very well indeed. It's so beautifully crafted, and it's clear that this movie was made with lots of dedicated and hardworking hands. The visual effects are what you'd expect from J.J. Abrams - they're big, beautiful and seamless. There's a great balance between makeup prosthetics, practical effects and CGI. It's a welcome balance to the new trilogy. Other technicalities, such as cinematography, sound effects, film editing etc. are all pretty much flawless in their execution. However the most exciting technical aspect of the film I found was John Williams' score. Yes, there are a lot of reprising themes from the original trilogy, however there is a notable amount of new content. Perhaps nothing is quite so memorable as the opening credits music, or say the 'Imperial March', however the new themes are quite sweeping - a great addition to the Star Wars universe.Conclusively, I believe J.J. Abrams has got it right. Yes the film is definitely flawed, but he ultimately delivers us what we need - a fun, action packed, intense and humorous entry into the Star Wars universe. I wish I had payed more attention to the previous films so I could fairly rank them against The Force Awakens, however I can definitely agree that this is a very solid piece of entertainment. When watching this movie, go in with an open mind, but stay alert. The premise will have you on edge and the following revelations definitely deserve your attention! This is indeed a force to be reckoned with.9/10
ID_100119;10;8;Star Wars Episode 7: The Force Awakens is the long-awaited seventh installment in the Star Wars film series and the beginning of the brand new Sequel Trilogy. Without giving away too much, I'll say that it is the best Star Wars movie since The Empire Strikes Back. It does everything right that the Prequel Trilogy did wrong.Normally, I would write a synopsis here. This time I refuse to do so. There are so many secrets and twists in this film that revealing the smallest plot point could potentially spoil the entire movie. All I will say is that it takes place 30 years after the Original Trilogy. I will leave it at that.The whole film felt like a breath of fresh air to anyone wanting to see a new Star Wars movie. Almost everything in this film worked really well. The characters, new and old, lent themselves to so many memorable moments and even some great comic relief. Unlike the Prequels, which focused too much on politics, this film focuses more on the action and story. J. J. Abrams has proved that the Star Wars series is in the right hands at Disney, he was the perfect choice as the film's director. I already can't wait for Episode 8.I rate it a very high 9.5/10, the same rating as Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope.
ID_100122;10;10;For one of the most anticipated movies of all time its quite hard not to get overly excited for the newest edition for the Star Wars universe!With JJ Abrams at the helm of the latest release and with the majority of the original cast returning, there are ridiculously high bars set for this one - and understandably so!JJ does a great job at not going too over the top with graphics, instead opting for realistic props, characters and worlds. Nevertheless it is inevitable that some computer graphics are used - and there a quite a few new tricks that we have never seen in the Star Wars universe that get put into great effect in this release! I must say that whilst some people speculated that this would be a movie purely of lens flares...they have been mistaken. There is and will never be nothing like the opening credits which take us through what has happened over the last 30 years. A hotly debated and anticipated plot revealed, I think that they have done exactly what has been needed. Something new, together with something old - and nothing of something stupid.Having some of the original cast together with some great new talent really refreshed the story and helped to breathe fresh life into the franchise that we all love and care about.As I don't really believe in spoilers, I will simply say this - if you've been eagerly anticipating this movie and can't think of a better thing happening in your life... or if you are a low-mid level star wars fan, or even if you are new to the franchise - I think JJ has done a great job with Star Wars: The Force Awakens as there is something that will appeal to all members of the audience - whether you know any of the original story or not. You will not leave this movie feeling dissatisfied with all of the hype, media and the personal feelings of ultra-excitement that has surrounded it. In fact, at a bare minimum I would say I walked away thinking - now that, was worth the wait, worth the price and worth my time. If you walk away from this movie unsatisfied you have probably tried to look too far into this with plot lines and an already sour taste from the prequels (if you disliked them). If you are not a fan and didn't like all the excitement then I would ask - why did you even go and see the movie? You could have left a seat for somebody who would have appreciated the artwork that has been put together!All in all, this is as a standalone movie - seriously great. As part of the new trilogy - an excellent platform, and as part of the Star Wars Universe - a fresh, new and exciting addition. Well done to JJ Abrams and to all the cast and crew for once again, bringing all of the ideals and emotions you can expect with a real Star Wars movie - plus a couple of new tricks!
ID_100124;10;9;"I have never been a huge fan of the Star Wars films--especially after the last three films they made. Too often, in my opinion, the emphasis was merchandising cute characters to kids instead of making the best possible sci-fi film. Fortunately, now that George Lucas sold off the franchise, Disney actually has made a slightly darker and slightly more adult addition to the franchise...and I was thoroughly impressed.I really DON'T want to talk about the plot of ""The Force Awakens""-- mostly because the movie just debuted and I would prefer folks experience it themselves. However, I don't think it spoils it in any way to say that the film is a bit of the old and a bit of the new. So, folks who loved the earlier films (particularly the great ones) will be happy that the film is clearly Star Wars and has a lot of similar plot elements from the earlier movies. You also get to see some familiar faces. But there also are several new ones and they seem to have a bit more depth than usual. I particularly liked Finn (John Boyega) and Rey (Daisy Ridley)--they were not just formulaic characters and you really like and respect them.The bottom line is that the film very much kept my interest and Disney seemed much more focused on story and, especially, characterization. A thoroughly enjoyable film from start to finish."
ID_100125;10;10;First off, to those people who think that this is just a remake of A New Hope, it most certainly isn't. There are similar contrasts to it in parts, but in all honesty, isn't that what we all wanted? Everyone loves the Original Trilogy so much, why should we complain if there are some similarities? That doesn't make any sense to me. These people were just expecting too much in my opinion. They cannot be pleased with anything.I went in with high expectations, and I was blown away. It brought back everything I loved about the original movies. It was fantastic. Rey (Daisy Ridley) is amazing, and I'm excited to see her story continue in Episode VIII. I loved all of the characters actually (Finn, Poe and Kylo Ren were especially great). I thought the action scenes were spectacular. Disney really nailed it with this film.I was never a huge Star Wars fan before this film. I love the first films, but the prequel movies were lackluster at best. This film made me interested in this whole universe. I'm so excited to see what's to come. Kylo Ren and Rey have so much potential to be outstanding characters that'll be remembered forever. I'm incredibly excited for what's to come. 10/10.
ID_100126;7;3;"I don't know what it is, but it just seems like the soul of the Star Wars universe is missing. There is an emptiness that was only emphasized by killing off one of the main characters. It was almost like the director knew something was missing, and had to do this dramatic stunt just to make a surprise/shocking ending to add some sort of life to this shallow film.It's an empty shell trying to galvanize itself to something greater. If the next movie somehow (miraculously) pulls all of this together (and possibly brings the deceased character back to life) they might be able to continue the series. Otherwise, it's just another MockingJay imo.The good news is, at least there is a story. Is it important enough to extend the series by three or four more films? It all depends on the next movie. If they blow it in the next film, it's over. In fact, they may actually kill the entire franchise if they pull another ""Force Awakens"". I feel like I've lost interest in the whole franchise after watching this attempt.This may seem a little harsh, but I just watched the film, and I am expressing my first impressions precisely. The new younger characters are okay, but not even close to the caliber of Ford, Hamill, Fisher. Maybe it's a problem with what this generation produces and accepts (like Hunger games et al). Shallow is the best way to describe it. And, second-rate seems to be good enough for some evidently."
ID_100128;10;10;"Firstly it's obvious most people rating this film 1-2 stars are simply just saying ""tHiS iS a ReBoOt gO wAtCh tHe OrIgiNaL hurrr durrr"". It's simply blind hatred and it's clear most haven't seen THIS movie! Don't listen to the blind hate reviews!! They all have nostalgia goggles on from the original Star Wars movies! It's such a shame cuz I imagine it's angry 50 year olds just hate bombing the reviews cuz they have nothing better to do with their day lmfao.I put off watching this movie for so long because of all the negative reviews people were leaving, but man have I missed out. The first time I saw this movie was today on Disney+ January 2020, so 5 years after release. The only reason I decided to watch it was because now that Rise of Skywalker is out I figured it'd be a good time to watch the new trilogy. I LOVE all the Star Wars movies, the original 3 ep 4-6, + the new eps they made at the beginning of the century ep 1-3. IMO all the movies have been great sci-fi/action movies.Star Wars: The Force Awakens is another great sci-fi/action movie. I went into this with an open mind, not trying to look for comparisons between this movie and the original ""a new hope."" If you go into this movie looking to compare every single scene between the 2 movies you will probably not like this movie because you will nit-pick every single scene! But if you're like me and just turn your brain off and just enjoy the show the movie is very thoroughly entertaining! Tons of action and great story development.I'm 24 years old and found this movie very entertaining, and please understand I found the original Star Wars movies equally as entertaining when I was a little kid even though others would say they're boring. Also I didn't feel like they ""shove"" the woman main character into our faces as many others have stated. I usually hate when they force women/minorities into major roles of tv/movies simply to say ""look a woman could do this too"" or ""look this woman is so strong & independent just like a man"". This movie wasn't that. The female did a great job as well as Fin the black guy, they played their roles without  garbage being shoved down our throats.Finally the reason I wrote this review is to hopefully sway someone to watch this movie who was on the fence just like me. Please don't listen to the 1-2 star ratings. Sure some people may have actually hated the movie that much, but if you scroll through enough you will see that most super low ratings are just saying, ""screw this movie, watch the original"" lmfao, very constructive guys. It's a shame because if this movie wasn't review bombed it would definitely be a 9+ rating on IMDB and that's FACTS!"
ID_100129;10;9;This is the first movie i have ever gone to see back to back and I must say it lived up to the hype.Like most people when i first saw that Disney where going to be making new star wars movies I was a little disappointed because i thought that they would be more like the prequels than the originals. But JJ did a fantastic job of making the film fresh and at the same time you knew it was a star wars film.I loved Rey and think that she is better than Anakin in the prequels, and I might even say she is on par if not better than Luke. i hope that the 2 other main movies and the spin off movies are just as good if not better than episode 7.
ID_100130;10;10;My childhood was filled with the original trio of Star Wars movies, numbers IV/V/VI in the series, and they blew me away. A New Hope (IV) remains one of my all-time favourite movies. As a result, I found the prequels a complete letdown, as did many others. So I approached The Force Awakens (VII) with some reservations.We saw it in the IMAX, best seats in the centre, and the 3D effects were excellent, as was the audio. The acting was top-notch, from new and old cast members. The script was snappy and there was some great humour interspersed with some really touching moments.The different generations of actors really meshed well and there was obvious chemistry between them all.The story moved along at a cracking pace (the two hours+ flashed past in no time!). The CGI was well used and meshed well with the traditional effects. The locations were amazing, as was the cinematography. JJ Abrams has created a worthy addition to the series and I await the next instalment keenly!
ID_100131;10;10;"It's truly sad to see a minority of social rejects hating on this wonderful piece of cinematic art, because it almost had me (who's also an old-school Star Wars fan) in tears.What most people want to know is what separates ""The Force Awakens"" from the prequels and it's actually easy to determine:The characters. There were almost no lovable characters in the prequels, but the new actors in 'Force Awakens' are not only doing a great job, but also conquer a place in your heart faster than you would ever think.Especially Daisy Ridley's performance was outstanding, even more so if you consider that she doesn't have much experience regarding big movie appearances. Oscar Isaac and John Boyega are also doing a great job and you just do not get bored of their characters, but of course ... the most brilliant actor besides Daisy Ridley in this movie is definitely Adam Driver. I will not spoil any story details, but I will say this: The Force Awakens is a wonderfully crafted movie with such love for detail that it left me breathless and astounded! Go watch it without any prejudices and you will experience an absolutely fantastic movie and a more than worthy sequel to the old trilogy."
ID_100132;10;10;I have no idea why there is so much hate on this movie. This is one of my favorite movies ever! This passed the original by a complete landslide. There are three very critical reasons why it is better than the original.1) Better effects - Obviously the effects are going to surpass the original because of the time difference.2) Better plot - This one brings a whole new level of greatness.3) The New Jedi - Not going to say who it is, but I love this person a lot.All in all, I would definitely recommend going to watch this movie. A+
ID_100133;6;1;"I managed to fall asleep two times at the end of the movie. Today's art of movies is based on ""some guy behind the computer and CGI software"". Crews of many people who had jobs for making good movies are long gone. I didn't know if I was watching a movie or a cartoon. Effects from 1977 are much better and realistic from these in 2000's - because people were making those effects, not some nerd behind the keyboard and a crappy software. Old crew from the movie is obviously tired from acting, being there just as a stone with a few dialogues. New crew is selectively taken to finish the movie at the beginning - no charm, no energy, nothing at all, starting from their looks, appearance and acting skills. Director of photography, screenplay, director and everything else is given free to a CGI ""mastermind"" as usual. With all the lost of creativity, this movie is ruined like many others were before - Terminator, Jurassic Park, Indiana Jones, Rocky, Rambo, YOU NAME IT ! If you want to be raped like Indiana Jones was in one of the episodes in South Park, go ahead, who knows, maybe you'll like it."
ID_100134;10;10;"17 December 2015 Film of Choice at Just After Midnight at The Plaza Dorchester - Star Wars: The Force Awakens. With much shushing there was silence in the auditorium, a dark screen filled only with stars........then those two wondrous words written in yellow and the familiar blast of music......every single person clapped and cheered and we were immediately thrust into a comfortable familiar place which was presented in a whole new 21st Century way. As the credits were rolling at the end I overheard someone say ""there are no words to describe how good that film was!"" I totally agree but I will do my best. When I first heard Disney had assumed the mantle of this beloved franchise I must admit my heart sank, I'm of the generation who queued for the very first film in the very first week back in the seventies and I was dreading how this latest edition would turn out. As filming progressed and stories were being leaked I became more hopeful, and as of this evening I can only say what a completely marvellous job has been made of this film. Following the story was a mixture of emotions, we met new characters who slotted in easily with old favourites, and the appearance of each of said old favourites was like wearing your old slippers and a big floppy jumper it was so familiar. New technologies were apparent which appeared side by side with 21st century mannerisms and behaviour yet there were many references to the previous films in the form of phrases, looks, actions or merely set design and props. There was also much humour, at points the audience were laughing out loud. I watched this latest episode just after midnight and wondered if I would stay awake.......I never moved a muscle throughout and thoroughly approved of the huge round of applause that accompanied the closing credits. Only one character I must bring to your attention........the new droid BB8......I want to take him home! No spoilers here......YOU MUST WATCH IT and love it as much as I do."
ID_100135;6;2;"Dear Star Wars fans, this comment is meant for you. Did you expect, as I did, the long waited rebirth of the greatest fantasy saga of all time? Then I assume you also felt a huge sense of disappointment. The unexpressed potential of this movie reaches frustratingly high levels : shallow jokes, clichés, bad visual effects... This really couldn't have been worse. We should all consider the opportunities given to directors nowadays : unlimited budget, amazing technological means and countless examples of awful science fiction to avoid. How many artists wish they had this miraculous set of tools back in the Seventies of the Eighties? However these gifts are still wrapped up and hidden, no one chose to see what's inside the packages, but, in my opinion, the omission wasn't caused by lack of curiosity or audacity. Somehow the public still demands a taste of tradition, even in science fiction, and the producers' only desire is to fulfill the expectations of the audience (even if, in order to achieve their goal, they managed to conceal a remake under the ""sequel"" label)."
ID_100136;10;10;"Ignore all the troll-worthy complaints on here. They are from people that have idolized Star Wars so long that the original trilogy have become a 20/10 movies, so when they get a 10/10 they trash on it. Ignore all the people that call it a ""Remake"" of episode 4, it's no more a remake than Episode 6 was.In truth, this is an Amazing film, and the first of 7 Star Wars films Disney is releasing in the next 7 years. (7,8,9 and 4 prequels) and it did a fantastic Job introducing a new Generation to Star Wars. The theater had 20 good guy laughs, and 10 cheers. I can't wait to see the next 6 Films!"
ID_100137;10;10;J.J. Abrams managed to deliver what fans have craved for the last three decades: a Star Wars film that is actually good. The film manages to capture the spirit of the original trilogy, and presents it with skilled acting, plausible dialogue, and ass-kicking, multi-layered characters (for the first time ever). I'm eager to see how the Star Wars universe develops now that it's finally in capable hands: Abrams and his associates understand Lucas's creation better than Lucas ever did.
ID_100138;8;9;As someone who grew up watching the original trilogy (that's the ones from '77-'83 that starred Harrison Ford, Mark Hamill, and Carrie Fisher), I was a little stoked to watch this one with those three returning. Ford appears the most in this and he makes the most of his presence. The funniest lines are from him and it's such a joy when he's on screen. Ms. Fisher doesn't seem as charismatic as in her previous stints as Leia but she's still pretty good at what she's required being now an older version of her. She and Ford have some nice scenes together. Hamill doesn't appear much so we'll have to wait for the next one in the series to see how he fares though I did like his beard at the end. The new players, mainly Finn and Rey, are good enough as characters. J.J. Abrams does a good enough job taking over for George Lucas. This was quite exciting for me and my movie theatre-working friend. So on that note, I recommend Star Wars: The Force Awakens.
ID_100139;6;7;I like Star Wars. I have seen them all and enjoyed them when they came out. Yes to the flaws, inconsistencies, less than stellar performances and story-lines. Those things didn't stop me from having a good time. They still don't. Now, that being all said, let me let you in on a little secret that has been used on you and you don't know it yet THE JEDI MIND TRICK at work. You will go see Star Wars. You will love it. You will tell all your friends. You will relive your childhood or late blooming. You will return to the days of yesteryear. You will get your monies worth. You will & you will and you will. Whew...Come out from under the Jedi Mind Trick for just one moment please....If you want to have the time of your life, spend good money on an investment/keepsake and instead of going to see this current release right away, go purchase the original movies. YOU WILL not be disappointed. YOU WILL get your monies worth etc etc. This is no Jedi Mind Trick! Here's the thing...I expected new ground. I honestly believed this movie would cover new ground but instead it covered where we have all been before. Furthermore, you have to make some effort to allow for an elderly Hans Solo, Leia and of course for old times sake say hello to some of the old favorites you have seen before but here is the question..Why go down memory lane? Why should you? Why not take us where Star Trek took us which is where no man has been before? Instead, its memory Lane and don't get me wrong, it is not punishment but instead disappointing that with all this technology and ideas floating around in the Star Wars Galaxy, they couldn't capture an original story? This should be called the Return of the Four Billion episode. Did someone at Disney say...Play it safe! We need to get our 4 billion back that we paid Lucas. Just rehash some things, add some music to it, big screen it, turn up the hype and yes, we will need the old Jedi Mind Trick if we are ever to get our 4 billion back right away. You will get the money back. You will not stop until you do. You will follow this formula...The Jedi Mind Trick...works every-time. The reasoning at Disney? All prior movies pulled in a total of billions. Merchandise is pulling in hundreds of millions. Why mess with success? Guaranteed sure thing out of the box, can't lose is the rehash concept. Think: same medicine different bottle with same effect. If I wanted to see the same storyline minus the different faces or so slight changes, buy the old box set and revisit what you already saw and have come to love as mentioned previously. This current movie can be added to the treasure trove later on. Its not a we have to rush out and go see this at all costs type of movie...unless it is. Again, the Jedi Mind trick. You must see this. You have to see this. Imagine visiting with new ideas, story-lines, concepts that take us into that Galaxy a long time ago and far far away. If done properly, the movie becomes a must see again. Saying that, there are no memorable scenes here meaning that you want to see them again. I respect the other point of view so relax, do not argue and just enjoy (if you can), my point of view. In effect, Disney is milking the Star Wars cow. We loved them, we saw them and we accepted them. Now, Disney, needs to prep the current generation and the one coming after this one and the one after that to accept it all over again. Why? They are spending more billions to redo Disneyland with the Star Wars theme and they like getting their monies worth and then some. I am in support of that too but keep it fresh. So here's to the next Star Wars movie. May it be original, exciting, have depth, break new ground, hire the best writers, and be of such a high quality movie going experience that no JEDI MIND TRICK is necessary. Let the love of the entertainment well done... beckon us all. No Tricks either!

ID_100144;6;2;An inflation of fan hysteria, it is the epitome of Hollywood's contemporary 'art' and the, subjectively(somehow it's important to emphasize this word in the dark ages of today), worst Star Wars movie yet. When real art is accused of having no story, read 'MAD MAX: FURY ROAD', you proceed to repeat eternally in your mind that people are idiots -- a fact that needs perpetual proof from time to time.Anyways, this overrated piece of dark-brown, fly buzzing stench remakes the first movie of the epic space opera, a repeatable remark that you will encounter in the other reviews. The 'science fiction' genre is replaced with the 'fantasy' genre, mainly because of the influence of 'Game of Thrones', only without tits and blood.I will not go into details, this is a spoiler proof review, however I will advise you on a couple of things: The critics are paid to praise this movie -- there are no good critics (including myself), which means that if you liked the movie, you will hate this review, and vice-versa. And for the ones that haven't watched the new Star Wars movie -- just go watch the new Mad Max instead, if you haven't yet. It is among the best art pieces (probably the best) that Hollywood spawned in the 21st century.
ID_100145;9;7;It's just sad. People come back to the force awakens and give it a worse review because they didn't like Last Jedi or Rise of Skywalker and thus have to hate on the entire trilogy. Sad. Sad. Sad.
ID_100146;6;5;I recently bought this movie. I did not go see it on the big screen as I just did not want to fight the crowds and boy would I have been upset after I saw it. Yes special effects were pretty good. That said I feel a lot of the movie was like the very first Star Wars the café club scene for one the bigger death star just a lot of similarities. The acting was pretty bad the guy they picked to play Kaylo was not very sinister looking and his voice was all wrong for this part. I did like the some of the characters BB-8 kinda grew on me as I felt sure from all I read about I might not like care for him. If your a true die-hard fan of the first Star Wars movies you will see what I mean. Go see it for the effects if nothing else.Michael
ID_100148;10;9;As a 30 something who grew up on the original trilogy and like so many others was utterly disappointed by the prequels I went into viewing The Force Awakens with great anxiety and reservation. This movie delivered in so many ways. I am not going to write a detailed or even general review of the film as I truly feel one should go into viewing knowing as little as possible. This is one time I think the critics are on track, as evidenced by the overwhelmingly positive reviews and Fresh rating from critics on rotten tomatoes. It's actually higher than any previous Star Wars movie--including the much praised Empire. My advice is this: Try to sit in the theater and enjoy this movie. If you try to dislike it... you might just succeed. But I can honestly say this is the most fun I've had watching ANY movie in a long time. P.S. Don't watch this with a negative nancy type imbecile, watch it with someone who enjoys fun, exciting and well made movies!
ID_100149;9;10;10 years later from the hated star wars prequel trilogy, this nostalgic movie gets back and it Don t disappoints, with a new hope references, a magical pure directon from JJ Abrams, New great carecters, a great universe expendeition and incredible fight scenes, The Force Awakens gets back in the high way, being for me one of the bests
ID_100150;6;3;If I had to describe Star Wars: The Force Awakens in a single word, it would be overrated. Or, perhaps, plagiarism. Or maybe nostalgia. All three apply pretty well.In the end, SWTFA borrows way too much from the original movie and cuts no new ground at all, including technically. This cannot be said of the original movies, where the first three minutes, consisting of a Star Destroyer chasing down Princess Leia's diplomatic shuttle, set the gold standard for science fiction movies for two decades and still is considered one of the most amazing openings in movie history. I have a lot to say about this movie, but my time is precious and I've decided to limit my critique to bullet points as wasting more time on SWTFA is not something I'm happy to do.* J.J. Abrams is VASTLY overrated as a director. Not as bad as M. Bay or that ilk, but really lacks vision and took no risks what-so-ever with this movie. One upside is that he is a marginally better story teller than Lucas is and does not sacrifice story telling for visuals as much as Lucas does.* Acting is largely wooden and stilted, even from the old veterans. Han is not the Han of old for instance. It is always a mistake to have too many old characters and settings appear in a spin off series such as this.* Way too much borrowed from the original A New Hope. New death star, new rebel alliance, new empire, yadda yadda yadda. Really, there are no new ideas at all in this movie and no risks are taken to advance the story or expand the universe.* Poor casting and poor use of the acting talent. The new Vader, Kylo Ren aka Adam Driver is about as intimidating as a kitten with a ball of yarn. He is supposed to be easily unhinged and loose control, but he comes off as silly. Every scene he was in reminded me of Severus Snape (from the Potter series) or Alan Rickman's Sheriff of Nottingham (from Robin Hood, Prince of Thieves). Captain Phasma is hardly used at all. * Was there background music in this movie? I don't remember any and one of the great things about the originals was the incredible score by John Williams that set the scene transitions and really added dramatic emphasis. * Nothing really special in the special effects. None of the battles are all that spectacular or special. Many of the X-wings and tie-fighters seem to be physics free even in the atmosphere of a planet. * Poor pacing, especially in the middle of the movie. The most compelling story in the movie occurs when Rey is having flashbacks about the past and the Jedi. Expanding on this would have made a far far better movie. They should have also supplied some exposition or, better yet, actually shown the Battle of Jakku. Again, would have been much more compelling.* Splurged for 3D. Really not worth it. There was only one scene where 3D was impressive, and that was simply a stationary Star Destroyer. I'm glad Star Wars is seeing a rebirth, but this movie was a rough start. I'd say worse than the hated prequels. They did leave a direct lead in to the next movie and I hope that the mistakes made in The Force Awakens are examined and learned from to make better movies, but I doubt that will happen.
ID_100151;10;10;The good news is you don't really need to watch the original Star Wars films in order to follow along with this film. But then honestly, why wouldn't you have seen the original Star Wars films? Star Wars is really an amazing franchise, starting in 1977 with the very first film. Can you imagine watching that in its inception? All these years later, you're still in awe of the characters, the story, the effects, the set pieces--the whole universe. The sets don't even look that different in this one than the ones from the '70s. Yet, we're still in awe.Without giving too much away, Star Wars: The Force Awakens revolves around the First Order (the dark side) trying to control the galaxy while racing against the Resistance (the light side) to find the disappeared Luke Skywalker. The film mixes old characters with a band of new characters--characters that you're going to love--and doesn't stray from what was so charismatic about the original movies.The film truly has that classic feel to it--from the scene cuts to the camera-work to the dialogue. This isn't your Marvel movie, folks. In fact, it makes us rethink what exactly we love about those films to begin with. I mean, we have Star Wars back now. What more could we want? But there is a different kind of levity brought here that we actually may be able to actually thank Marvel for. It's not too much, but the perfect amount. In the originals, they would have never dared make light of any scene involving Darth Vader, but here we are given one surprising, yet heedful laugh during a bit that involves the neo-Darth Vader, Kylo Ren--who is just as bit of creepy and sinister as Vader.The newcomers, John Boyega as an ex-stormtrooper, Finn, and Daisy Ridley as a orphaned scavenger, Rey, will have no problems being the new faces of the franchise. Their characters have a lot of depth already, with much more yet to be explored.Harrison Ford is back as Han Solo, and he's better than he's ever been. His performance is actually award-worthy. I mean, just give the guy an Oscar already (he's only had 1 nomination ever--seriously).And what is Star Wars without a couple twists? The ones that we're given are great, and you know they're stringing you along for more. They don't answer every question in this film. They answer a lot, but still leave you talking afterwards and speculating. It teaches us to be patient and we're surprisingly okay with that. The film doesn't give in to the immediate gratification that the Avengers culture usually demands.It runs at 135 minutes, but feels no longer than 100. The pacing is basically near-perfect, which attributes to it's deceptive length.I truly didn't want it to end. It's the year's best film and perhaps the best one I've seen in at least 5 years. It gave me the happy chills about eleven different times. I can't even begin to explain how good it is. I guess you're just going to have to see it for yourself. Who am I kidding? Everyone's about to watch this movie. But that's Star Wars for ya.Twizard Rating: 100
ID_100153;8;10;I'm not objective on this. I know. I don't care. I love Star Wars. This has all the Star Wars feeling from beginning to end. The plot works. The characters are well defined, are different from each other and feel authentic. The way we're introduce to each of the old classics is exemplary. I love it.
ID_100154;10;10;"'STAR WARS: THE FORCE AWAKENS': Five Stars (Out of Five)The seventh installment in the immensely popular space opera film series; and the first chapter in over ten years. It takes place 30 years after the events of 'RETURN OF THE JEDI'; when the Galactic Empire has now become 'The First Order', and the rebel alliance has now become the 'Resistance'. The story deals with a First Order stormtrooper, named Finn, who's looking for redemption; after gaining possession of a map, to Luke Skywaler's whereabouts. The film was directed by J.J. Abrams; and it was written by Abrams, Michael Arndt and Lawrence Kasdan (who also co-wrote 'THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK' and 'RETURN OF THE JEDI'). Harrison Ford, Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher, Peter Mayhew, Anthony Daniels and Kenny Baker all reprise their roles, from the original trilogy; and they're joined by newcomers Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, Adam Driver and Oscar Isaac. The series creator, George Lucas, returned as a creative consultant; and John Williams once again scored the music (as he did all six previous chapters, in the franchise). I think it's the most entertaining movie, I've seen, in 35 years!We first learn that Luke Skywalker (Hamill) has gone missing; and due to his absence, the ruthless First Order has gained power, and control, over the galaxy. Princess Leia Organa (Fisher) is now a general, of the Resistance, and she believes finding Luke is humanity's only hope. She sends her best X-wing fighter pilot, named Poe Dameron (Isaac), to the desert planet of Jakku; in order to locate a map, which can lead to her brother's whereabouts. On his mission Poe meets a stormtrooper, looking for redemption, named Finn (Boyega). Finn joins Poe in his adventure; he also later teams up with a scavenger, named Rey (Ridley), and a veteran war hero, named Han Solo (Ford).The film is definitely the best written, of the entire franchise; with clever, witty dialogue (for the first time, in the series). It also has the most humanity, and thoughtful drama (I cried multiple times). It's surreal seeing Han, Luke, Leia, Chewbacca, and other original cast members, on the big screen again (in a new movie); and I think it was justifiable asking Fisher and Hamill to lose weight, for their parts (it's necessary to the roles they're playing). The new characters are also extremely likable, and soon to be classic, as well. Ridley is a revelation, and I think she rivals Jennifer Lawrence; for one of the best performances of the year! Driver, Boyega and Isaac are all fantastic as well; and Ford is, once again, classic! The movie (without question) deserves several Oscar nominations; for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Original Screenplay, acting and more. The approach Abrams takes, to the material, is exactly right (it's traditional, old fashioned filmmaking). The film is everything you could possibly expect (or want) from a 'STAR WARS' movie; it's funny, heartfelt, touching and action-packed. All of the best parts of the previous installments, with none of the cheese! It's at least the best in the series since 'THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK'!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://vimeo.com/149466777"
ID_100155;6;3;While this movie isn't bad per se, it's about as surface-level as a film can get. It's a cash grab. I hadn't heard a thing about the movie before watching it, so I went into the experience without any bias whatsoever.I don't think this even deserves a lengthy review which explains everything that's wrong with it. All you need to know is this movie isn't an evolution on Star Wars and I think that's what we all somewhat expected in 2016. It's basically a remake that failed.Events just happen in this movie because they do. That's why. There's no significant background or genuine emotion being projected from any of the characters. Is it entertaining? Sure. But it isn't good. It's stale, lacks character development, and only wants to impress you with late 1970s effects.
ID_100156;9;9;"Easily the best Star Wars film in the sequel trilogy.
It was a good basis and I loved the rendition to a new home which was clever by Abrams.
Should be appreciated by many.
Shame the last Jedi didn't quite follow that down that path that Abrams left...
JJ Abrams should have directed the whole sequel trilogy and I'm sure if that would've been the way.. The outcome sure as hell would've been different from a very divided Star Wars fan base."
ID_100161;7;8;"1977 people saw for the first time the big title of Star Wars on the big screen, and after Star Wars: The Revenge of The Sith came out 2005 the world known franchise went disappearing. I saw The Force Awakened 2015 on its premiere night and it was clear that people had been waiting long for Star Wars to return to the big screen, and there is no doubt that J.J Abrams must have felt much pressure taking this franchise back to the big screen as it is certainly one of the most loved and respected movie franchises in the world. Much has changed between 1977-2015 and the world we humans live in daily have changed much both for good and for bad. But one of the great changes that have happened in the world is that women and colored people are allowed a bigger role in movie production both in front of the camera and behind it. To see Daisy Ridley and John Boyega as the two main protagonists was an amazing experience as they both looked like they truly enjoyed themselves and both delivered their performances with nothing but excellence. Adam Driver also delivered a solid performance and it was a complete joy to see Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher return to the big screen and to the galaxy far far away. The movie itself was an amazing space adventure form the beginning to end and I thought that J.J Abrams really captured the magic and feeling of Star Wars just as George Lucas did for the first time in 1977. The movie had a very good balance and it had many things that could be enjoyed by the longtime fans but also much new for the new generation whom some witnessed Star Wars for the first time. And yeah I'll admit it. I was one of those guys who suddenly ""got something in his eye"" when Han Solo & Chewbacca came into the shot and Han said: ""Chewie we're home""A must see for all fans of space adventure and definitely for all who love Star Wars!10/10 Amazing!"
ID_100162;10;9;We've waited.... and waited..... and here it is! The Force Awakens is everything we've come to love about Star Wars. It's big, it's epic, it's spectacular. And underneath, there's actually a big heart to it all. You get a sense from watching it, that it was made by true fans of the series. I won't give away any real spoilers- but rest assured Jar Jar Binks does not put in an appearance, so remain calm. The good guys are very likable, I thought the relationship between Ray and Finn worked out very well. It gave the film it's emotional anchor. The villains are pretty much what you would expect, but the filmmakers threw in a few twists about them that were welcome.Add some terrific space battles, and you get a very welcome return to the greatness of Star Wars. Go and see it (but you already know you will). Take a friend or a family member. You'll have a great time. Because that's what these films are about when it comes down to it. Overall, Force Awakens shows off some snazzy visual effects combined with a compelling story and great characters. It won't disappoint.
ID_100163;7;9;"In a galaxy far, far away Star Wars. It's about time we should see that opening to a film. 10 years since the last Star Wars Film, J.J Abrams takes the time to get it right. And he does it perfectly. I won't say anything about the plot, because I'm sure you want to find what it is yourself. But I will tell you of a New, Epic Adventure. The Force Awakens gets it right. It blends old and new together in a way the prequel Trilogy really failed to do. We had new characters( Finn, Rey, Poe, Kylo Ren, BB-8) and old ( Han Solo, Chewbacca, Leia, C3PO, R2-D2), that combined together to make a fitting and suitable Stars Wars film that would make George Lucas Proud. The Force Awakens doesn't make the mistake of copying everything awesome about the original trilogy, but it respects and honours it. It makes its only original story, and it really is quite a great story. But that's enough of me, I think you would rather see this Fantastic Film then listen to me ramble on about it"
ID_100164;7;10;So disappointed. Can only assume that the previous ratings are based on brain washed fans so happy to hear the anthem and see the yellow writing scroll up the screen that they didn't bother to watch what followed. The aforementioned opening was by far the highlight. 30 mins in and I had to nudge myself to stay awake. 60 mins in I would have walked out in disgust if I didn't think I would offend my wife and daughter who had decided to accompany me on my quest to re-capture my youth. The lack of a story was unbelievable. The main villain is a fluffy bunny next to Vader, Maul or Sidious. What rocket scientist decided that Stormtroopers were no longer clones. I'd be easily convinced that Abrams hadn't even watched the original movies, if it wasn't for the shameful way that every scene from Episode IV had been woefully reproduced. Predictable and not an original scene in the movie. I know you have to watch it, but do yourself a favour and wait till it hits TV.
ID_100165;4;10;"""What did you come back for?"" - the first question I would ask the creators of the new Star Wars trilogy...Disappointment is all, the story was perfectly finished, the character lines are logically closed, so why did you decide to continue again, introduce new characters, start a completely different story and somehow connect it with the original one? The answer is simple - popularity and money.I really love the Star Wars franchise, which is why it hurts me to watch them ruin everything, starting with episode 7 and ending with the future 9th...Moreover, this is not just a sequel, this is some kind of unsuccessful remake, in which they tried to repeat in a different form all the chips of the 4 part - and it turned out, to put it mildly, ridiculous and terrible..."
ID_100166;2;10;"The best thing I could say about this movie, is that it has set itself up for a better sequel. I'm just going to go ahead and list my grievances, without giving anything away: -""Knowledge of the force"" was a very important factor in how good a Jedi was at fighting over the first six movies. There was years of training, infinite hurdles. That all goes out the window. Apparently, anyone can beat a Sith lord. -The premise of the main characters, their motives and backgrounds, was so much less believable (even as a fictitious storyline). -The fight scenes were less like the epic battles of Episodes I, II, and III, and more like the fight between Obi-Wan and Vader. -The villain was so boring. Abrams didn't pull any brain muscles thinking him up. -The story altogether was extremely weak -Finally but most importantly, this was less of a sequel and more of a remake of Episode IV. I won't tell you how, but you'll see it.Good things about this movie: -Stunning 3D visuals -The imperial starships are as cool as ever -Han Solo is still a bossI want to tell readers to just go watch it with lowered expectations.. but there are no expectations low enough to make this movie a good watch. Just don't bother going"
ID_100167;10;10;"There has been an awakening and it is awesome! No offense to those Ewoks, but STAR WARS: THE FORCE AWAKENS is the best 'Star Wars' movie since 'The Empire Strikes Back.' This film is exciting, it's fun, but it's also heart-wrenching and deeply affecting. Clearly the result of a work done with care.Now this a spoiler-free review, I'm going to keep it that way because this film does have a pivotal plot point that if you spoil it, it would certainly ruin the entire experience. So the secret must be kept until you see it for yourself, it is that crucial.The story is set years after the events in ""Return Of The Jedi,"" Leia is now a general leading the resistance, and Luke Skywalker has gone missing, the mystery of his whereabouts is constant throughout the film, it is what drives the good guys and the first order, finding Luke becomes their cause. Oscar Isaac plays a great pilot named Poe Dameron who gets captured by the villain Kylo Ren (Adam Driver). But a stormtrooper with a conscience, Finn (John Boyega) helps Finn escape, a situation which then leads to Finn encountering Rey, (Daisy Ridley) a scavenger who's just trying to get by and survive each day. A new adorable droid, BB8, enters their lives and gives them a mission which leads them to Millennium Falcon and Han Solo. These young ones learn about the past, that the jedi and the force are all real. Meanwhile a threat far more sinister and much larger than the death star is wreaking havoc. These new characters will ultimately have to choose whether to stay as who they are or become something more.What's awesome about STAR WARS: THE FORCE AWAKENS is that J.J. brought back everything we loved about the old original ""Star Wars"" films. He brought back all the fun and excitement that the prequels lacked because those episodes I,II, and III were too busy trying too hard to be political thrillers. J.J. brought back the Millennium falcon and the thrill of aerial fight. Even the light saber fights on the ground are extremely well-choreographed, they keep you on the edge of your seat.I think the new kids on the block, Boyega, Isaac, Driver, Ridley, all did a fantastic job, and they can go toe-to-toe with the legends, Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher and Luke Skywalker. I think the writers, J.J. Abrams, Lawrence Kasdan, and Michael Arndt smartly written the film in a way that would bridge the gap between these two generations. STAR WARS: THE FORCE AWAKENS is nostalgic for us who've been fans ever since we could remember, but it embraces new fans who may not know much but will now learn more because of this film. It's a great way to pass the baton, it also makes way for the next installment, EPISODE VIII and IX.This is a very well thought-out film, not a single boring note, nothing about it seems hasty or abrupt, it's well-structured and well-crafted from start to finish. I love how Rey and Finn start out not having a purpose but they end up choosing their own, this is not about destiny placed upon you, it's still up to them in the end, just like how it's my choice to plan on watching this film again and again until I memorize every single line and dialogue.You geek out when you see something familiar, you geek out when you see something new, you laugh, you cry, you can feel your pulse pounding through the action sequences, STAR WARS: THE FORCE AWAKENS is why you go to the theaters. Any of us who had doubts when Disney bought Lucasfilm can now admit that that may have actually been a pretty smart move on their part, definitely a good thing that happened to this property."
ID_100168;8;3;"As I said before, I am not a Star Wars fan but all of these films are very exciting and very entertaining. This one, Force Awakens, is a pretty strong and astonishing eye candy with plot to match and excellent actors' chemistry to binge watching and enjoy.
I need not retell the plot but what I can say, this is a fine element of a bigger mosaic and as a definitive piece it holds well, showing that not only excellent CGI or great vision can create a stunning effect, but also a thoughtful idea, careful approach to depicting baddies, strong twists and very subtle grain of humor add a real lot of greatness and grandeur.
Good movie with Daisy Ridley and Harrison Ford as well as Adam Driver shining great and not allowing te plot to slide into banality or sentimentality.
I await a new episode and hope they will prove more."
ID_100169;6;2;"When I watched this movie it looked good to me; better than most fiction movies I watched in 2005. I think it's 8.3 IMDb rating is justified but I didn't get why this movie has got so many bad reviews. I think I have never seen any movie which got so many bad reviews on IMDb and still enjoys 8.3 overall rating. This prompted me to watch the earlier star war episodes and I got my answer.This movie doesn't do justice with the original star wars trilogy. It lacks imagination as the plot is a mixture of the events from earlier episodes. And most importantly it failed to live up to spiritual essence of star wars saga. It is a huge commercial success but a disappointment to hardcore star wars fans. I hope the coming episode might be able to rescue this trilogy like the third episode did to some extent."
ID_100171;5;10;"OK, first, the reason for the 5/10 is that I could not watch it again. There is not a lot of plot tension or complexity, and the movie is a little long and schmaltzy ... but, this is so much better than I thought it would be, I am glad I went to see it, it was fun.""The Force Awakens"" like all the Star Wars movies doesn't make much sense, but it had the feeling of the Star Wars series that even the Stars Wars official movies had kind of lost. That make a big impression on me. I really did not expect much, and I sadly went assuming I might just be fed up and have to leave after a few minutes, like I wanted to in the Star Trek reboots, which I hated with a passion.But the movie is beautiful, it is true to all the style and shots and quirks of Star Wars, but that means it is also thin, vapid, silly and basically low IQ Science Fantasy for kids. So, it is that kind of movie. Which is acceptable, that is all is had to be. It is just a movie to watch and eat popcorn and then talk about how this scene reminded you of another movie or situation.Star Wars was one of a kind, in its own time, and it really cannot be recreated, but this movie is hugely successful financially, or course, and so it met expectations - that is an amazing accomplishment, for Star Wars, For JJ Abrams and for the customers.Again, the movie is beautiful, the images and sets awesome, the views spectacular, and the style true to form ... a great job for a sentimental mediocre movie that will give lots of people two hours of great fun ... once!It would have been nice if Abrams had been able to accomplish the same with Star Trek, but i don't think he really understood Star Trek as he understands Star Wars."
ID_100172;8;9;"My review is pretty much going to be one of those that are going to be unhelpful for all, I'm afraid. I only write these things so that when I pass on from this mortal world, something of me will remain. With this film though, I did not utterly love it and give it a ten so those that did are going to hate my review while on the other hand I did like the film and did not give it a one, so those that hated it or really disliked it will hate my review. I literally read a review where a person gave this film a one, but there were things he enjoyed about the film. Um, if you give the film the lowest ranking that means there should not be anything in it you enjoyed. There are a whole lot of numbers between 1 and 10 to use! It matters not; the film was good to me as it was better than the prequels. Why? Well for one it had better humor. Another reason? It felt more real while the prequels I felt I was watching people in front of a green screen. I can keep going on, but yeah, this one is better than the prequels; however, that being said, it is not as good as any of the originals either. I was really enjoying the film up until the final act which felt kind of rushed. After a certain character takes a fall, the film just speeds along to its conclusion and I just felt more was needed.The story is a bit of a retread of the first Star Wars film, but I was expecting it to be more so than it was. I felt it had enough new to offer to keep me entertained. Well, like in the first film, a droid is tasked with the final piece of the puzzle as Luke Skywalker has been missing and a new order has arisen to fill the void of the evil Galactic Empire left behind. A young girl and a storm trooper who has had enough will try to get the droid back to the resistance fighters lead by General Leia who is desperately trying to find Luke. They shall get help from Han Solo who has gone back to smuggling and Chewbacca ever loyal Wookie. The new order though has a new weapon that takes the power of the sun to cause devastation and a new evil has appeared in the form of Kylo Ren, a man who wishes to be better than Vadar!It was cool seeing Harrison Ford as Han again and some of the old favorites. Han is about the only one from the original films to make more than basically a cameo appearance though. The new characters are pretty good as Fin the former storm trooper was a bit interesting as was Rey, a mysterious girl who seems to harbor some force powers of her own. My favorite new addition though was Poe as he was very enthusiastic and I am hoping he has a more extended role in the next film. I liked Kylo Ren at first, but he deteriorated kind of badly as the film went along and I am kind of hoping they introduce another Sith lord in the next film, because Ren just did not seem quite competent enough to poise much of a threat without some backup. As I said, the film felt a bit weak during its final act and this character was one of the reasons I felt it weak. As for the new Deathstar, I thought it looked cool and I loved it when that one commanding officer ordered it fired and it took out three planets, but at the same time, one would think they'd stop making them with such obvious weak points! So overall, I thought it was a good film. I am not sure it really warrants all this undue hatred I have seen from various people, nor do I really seeing it being the most awesome film ever. It was a pretty good Star Wars film and to me it felt like a Star Wars film, had they put a bit more effort into the conclusion I would have probably given it a nine, but an eight to me is a good film. A lot of movies this year have gotten eights, as very few movies released lately have really pushed my buttons enough for a higher score with the exception of the latest Mad Max film which is my favorite film I saw in theaters in 2015. This one though capped the year off nicely as I did not see anything that I did not enjoy at the theater this year. If this film had disappointed me like the prequels this would have been the last Star Wars film I was going to see, but I will be seeing the next installment which would be the eighth. Still unsure if I want to watch the Rogue Squadron one."
ID_100176;6;7;"I really liked this movie! Yes it's plot is similar to ""A New Hope"", but the execution is different enough to make it feel fresh. I've seen it twice. In Theaters in 2015 and today. I wanna quickly mention, that the cinematography by Dan Mindel is extremely underrated! It should at least have gotten an Oscar nomination. The score by John Williams is great as always, though not many original cues. ""Rey's Theme"" and ""March of the Resistance"" are however exceptions. Overall a really great experience, great characters, dialogue and a flowing pace delivered by J. J. Abrams. A 4/5 stars from me."
ID_100177;1;10;There is no way this film should be rated so highly. You're telling me it's as good as Lord of The rings, the original Star wars films, The Dark Knight, Fight Club etc....? No way... the plot was an exact rehash of Episode IV. Unoriginal, uninspiring, and lackluster all round. The only good thing about it was performances and the nostalgic music, sounds etc. As a stand alone film i'd give it like a 6/10, but since it's being rated so highly I'm going to give it a 1/10. An 8.8/10 film should be original, not a film that is an exact copy and paste of another movie from 30 years ago. I will say, it was better than the prequels in terms of acting, production etc. But even the prequels had better ideas, and MUCH better music. The music wasn't special at all in this - no Dual of The Fates etc etc. Overall im disappointed. Over-hyped to the max.
ID_100179;10;8;"The movie is undoubtedly made with a lot of details and attention, scenes are well crafted and the dialogues are well written. There's a classic feel of the old Star Wars movies to this and also the visuals of the new world. 
The old cast mark, Carrie, Harrison and the rest are as good as they've ever been and also the new crew Daisy and John are amazing. 
The score of the movie is the best I've heard in a long long time. The movie made over 2 billion dollars and well it desverved it."
ID_100180;6;8;"Director J.J. Abrams (""Lost,"" ""Star Trek Into Darkness,"" ""Mission: Impossible III"") steps into the future (again) to bring the latest of the Star Wars trilogy to the big screen. Not seeing any of the prior movies, I was poised and ready for an exciting film experience. Unfortunately, I feel asleep twice due to boredom. Sure, the spaceships are cool, the futuristic characters are interesting, and traveling through the galaxy looks like fun, but I've seen this all done before in any number of other space travel films/TV series. With something new to look for out of the question, I turned my attention to just enjoying the film for what it was and getting to know the characters. Unfortunately, the dialogue was so basic, I found it hard to stay interested. I was, however, amused to see Harrison Fords' character filled with so much dry-humor, and I now finally understand the attraction of the light-saber. Maybe if some new film technology had been introduced, the overall film would have meant more to this first timer. But, since that didn't happen, ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" just bored me with its familiarity. One of the highlights of the film was to see Adam Driver (""GIRLS"") step into such an iconic role within the film. Driver continues to be an interesting actor, and it's great to see him successful jump genres here. May the force be with those who love this trilogy!"
ID_100181;6;5;"Star Wars TFA is not a bad movie it's just meh. My biggest gripe with this movie is the blatant hypocrisy among movie goers, because this movie has more in common with the recent Transformer movies than Star Wars. It's a long winded awkwardly paced cgi fest with misplaced humor. When people say this ""captures the magic"" I really don't know what they're smoking...we must have saw different movies. One of the other major problems with the movie is that all the characters felt the same (few exceptions) this is due to the overly comedic script where people are constantly quipping back and forth and have an observational joke for literally everything. These forced comedic elements really took me out of the film, just by sheer volume alone. However the film has redeeming qualities like Kylo Ren he's just about the only innovation in it, everything else was been there done that better."
ID_100182;8;10;Greetings again from the darkness. In what can justifiably be termed a cultural event, director J.J. Abrams brings us Episode VII in a film franchise that date backs almost 40 years. While I was one of the lucky ones who waited patiently in line to see the first Star Wars on opening day in 1977, I can only be described as a series fan rather than a Star Wars geek. My bond is with Hans Solo and Chewbaca, so this is not the place to debate the minutiae of costumes, timelines and weaponry.What I can happily report is that Mr. Abrams (he's also directed Star Trek and Mission Impossible films) has found just the right blend of nostalgia, science-fiction, and geeky gadgetry to appeal to the widest of all audiences. The film is an honorable tribute to the previous six in the series, yet it's more than entertaining enough to stand alone for new comers.As we expect and hope for, the screen is filled with fantastical visuals that somehow push our imagination, while at the same time, feel realistic to the story and action. The aerial dogfights are adrenaline-pumping and spectacular in their vividness, and the more grounded action scenes feature Stormtroopers who have clearly had lots of target practice since the previous films.You need only watch the trailer or read the credits to know that some of the old familiar faces are back: Harrison Ford as Han Solo, Mark Hamill as Luke Skywalker, Carrie Fisher as Princess Leia, Peter Mayhew as Chewbaca, and of course, our old pals C-3P0 and R2D2. Also back is the remarkable composer John Williams – likely to receive his fiftieth (yes, 50!) Oscar nomination for his work here. In addition to the familiar, new faces abound: John Boyega as Finn, Daisy Ridley as Rey, Adam Driver as Kyle (don't call me Ben) Ren, Oscar Isaac as Poe, Gwendoline Christie as Captain Phasma, and Domhnall Gleeson as Captain Hux. There is also the magic of Andy Serkis as Supreme Leader Snoke, and an all-too-brief sequence featuring Max von Sydow. Oscar winner Lupita Nyong'o voices Maz Kanata, and there is an impressive list of other cameos available online if you are interested (Daniel Craig being the most eye-raising).Abrams along with action cinematographer extraordinaire Daniel Mindel take full advantage of all available technical aspects in creating stunning visuals and spine-tingling sound. It's a film made to be watched on the biggest screen with the best sound system, so ask around if you aren't sure. If you are a long-time fan of Han and Chewy, you'll enjoy catching up with old friends. If you are unfamiliar with the Star Wars galaxy, this latest will hook you into the force.
ID_100183;10;10;At long last we have been given a Star Wars movie that takes full advantage of what the universe has to offer. JJ Abrams has shown that he can handle a movie of this kind and balance all the elements that makes up the movie. I was, more or less, at the edge of my seat from start to finish, since I didn't want to miss the story when it really kicked off. And the movie kept me in suspense in a brilliant way, so that I never had a moments rest, and thus was fully entertained from start to finish. What really made me happy to see was that lots of the problems found in previous movies wasn't a problem here. In episode 1 - 3, it bothered me that the special effects had taken over to such a degree, that any story and acting was strangled. This is not the case in TFA. Here the effects are balanced so that, there are enough to blow you away, but tempered so that the story shines through and the actors get to show what they can do. In episode 1-6 we mostly see either under- or overacting. Of course some did a great job. It was a joy to see a movie where the acting was as it should be. In short, JJ Abrams has made the movie Star Wars fans have deserved and waited for.
ID_100184;7;8;"""This will begin to make things right."" The film starting with that line infuriates me. Though the prequels are not held in high esteem, the thought that this movie would course correct the franchise is asinine. Starting on a self-righteous note definitely leaves a sour note.That being said, this movie is a solid entry in the Star Wars universe. The ground work is set and it's a good re-introduction to the galaxy far, far away. The plot is formulaic and follows the structure of ""A New Hope"" very closely. That's not a bad thing, but it does lack some originality. The new trio of Rey, Finn and Poe is interesting. The legacy of the original trio, while in the background, is a joy to watch.There are some chill inducing moments, most coming in the third act involving one of the heroes and Kylo Ren. The humor wasn't too much for me and I found myself enjoying the banter between the characters. The lightsaber choreography is weaker than the prequels, but the action as a whole is decent.In the end, I like ""The Force Awakens"". It's definitely better than episodes 1 and 2, but worse than 3, 4, and 5. I find myself putting this movie in the same tier as ""Return of the Jedi"".Best Character: Finn
Best Moment: Rey force grabbing the lightsaber.Best Quote: ""The Belonging You Seek Is Not Behind You... It Is Ahead."" - Maz Kanata."
ID_100186;6;10;"Disney has taken Star Wars and PC-ed it to no shame.From the trailer, when it was first shown, the first comments feminists stated was how wonderful to see a black, a female and a Latino together and no white males. How wonderful it is for the world.Sci-Fi used to be made for men and it was great. Now what we have is the female awakening and Disney pandering to the fake audience and snot nosed kids who think Taylor Swift is an exceptional singer.This is made for the Disney Generation, the kids who were in diapers when the PREQUELS got made. The current SJW's, BLM's and feminists will adore this film as all creativity is gone, replaced with plot stolen from the first trilogy. At least the prequels tried to be original. Episode 7 is just stealing.This was a wet dream for many and the female lead is a unicorn. Untrained in the force, she is more powerful than Luke, Vader, Palpatine and Old Ben combined. They even ripped off Yoda with a female who was supposed to be older than Yoda but with more vitality? They made sure you knew it was not your daddy's Star Wars many times. While male Yoda was old and fragile, the older female Yoda was spry and hits on Chewy.It is devoid of real substance and plot. Instead it is BIGGER Deathstar? We have Stormtroopers but not Stormtropper, they are FIrst Order Troopers? Palpatine but not Palpatine as we have Snoke aka Gollum? There were a couple of scenes that made sure to let you know who they were pandering to. During the Rebels attacking the First order; the camera cuts to a Black pilot, then Asian female pilot, Alien, Alien, Latino. I chalked this up to everyone else accusing men of being chauvinistic, but another scene they did it again making sure you know this was NOT your daddy's Star Wars. This movie had cheesy one liners meant for kids to laugh to cover up plot holes. There was ZERO memorable scenes or musical scores. They even tried to re-hash the shock of ""I am your father,"" but obviously it fell flat.This reminds me of Terminator Genysis. They sacrificed the real fans who loved T1 and T2, for the bratty snot nosed PC crowd who loves everything they are told to love. Hipsters at their best who rely on others to make decisions for them.Luke was a side character and a rehash of Obi. Same out fit to boot. He is looking for, I kid you not, the FIRST Jedi Temple. This was a very videogamey plot to explain how the Empir.....I mean First Order rises. This movie lacked drama and seemed to be scenes just strung together. The characters were emotionless robots. Han and Leia had no chemistry. My gosh they had a kid and were together for a long time. In fact Han, Chewy, C3PO and R2D2 were just thrown in as an afterthought and to make money off the REAL fans.The plot actually has the Empire being annihilated by the First Order. This was the writers letting you know that this ""Star Wars is for the new generation and too bad real fans, Disney needs more money and the Disney/Gamer/SJW generation will give it.""Star Wars TFA was a letdown. it is not a continuation but a remake, a re-imagining, a poorer re-telling of the originals except BIGGER DeathStar;BIGGER Dark Lords; BIGGER explosions; BIGGER, BIGGER, BIGGER!!!! If you are a Hipster easy 8, If you are a purist, it is a 5. This is truly an SJW's wet dream."
ID_100187;10;1;This movie was by far the best movie of 2015. Go in with normal expectations and you will come out deeply content. Loved every bit of it. The movie has all the big bangs, flight sequences and special effects that you come to expect from a great Star Wars movie. I rarely watch a movie twice (the last one was The Dark Knight) but I cannot wait to re-visit this epic for another round. Counting the days until the next one!
ID_100188;4;10;First of all, the movie is not as bad as many others review it here. But the essence of these reviews is true: It just mirrors what Hollywood has become today. Episode VII is a uninspired ripoff of somebody else's ideas and therefore has no soul. But what is really annoying, considering the professionals involved, it has a poorly written script. It feels like a first draft that has been rushed into production. Abrams knows his job, he wrote Super 8, which is a well written movie. And Kasdan co-wrote Empire Strikes Back, which is the best star wars ever. I don't know what happened, maybe they tried to make it great and some studio boss messed it up. Or they didn't have enough time to make it right. Probably Abrams is just too busy producing. I wonder how the movie had turned out if a writer with a master skill set like Aaaron Sorkin or Quentin Tarrantino had written the script. Writers who really know their craft and can build up scenes that work for the story. This movie had, except a couple of good punchlines, not one well written scene. And that's too bad as Abrams knows how to direct a well written script.But there is something else missing in the writing than technical skills. What made the original trilogy great? Lucas did his research about ancient myths, archetypes, he referenced masterpieces of legend filmmakers (e.g. Kurosawa), he dug really deep and put all his creativity and passion into building a breathtaking world full of ideas. He was taking risks. But episode 7 just repeats what has worked before, without inventing something new. But maybe there is hope: Ryan Johnson could at least fix some of it and make a reasonable movie as he is also one of those talented writers out there. If they let him. Please do. Maybe the new trilogy becomes something like the matrix in reverse by starting terrible (matrix 3) and becoming really great (matrix 1). But there is one BIG problem now: the falcon is empty.
ID_100190;8;10;"A perfect beginning. I remember when the trailer of this came out. I was so hyped. ""STAR WARS IS BACK!!"" I said, and I was right. This movie is what star wars is about. And I never quite understood the ""A New Hope Rehash"" comments. Sure I get it sometimes. But come on, this is Star Wars. Most of the times the basic concepts are the same. Villain, hero, wise master who guides hero, end fight with fighters. Also the death of one character didn't feel forced, it felt right for the character and i love it. It's amazing how almost all star wars movies are insanely good. Man, I love star wars....and that's the feeling you're supposed to get watching these films."
ID_100191;8;10;This movie had so much potential to open a great trilogy. Movie as it self is good but it's copying a bit too much New hope
ID_100192;9;8;"Well 30 years have passed since the last, ""GOOD"" star wars movie, and with the current fashion of going back to a franchise that was meant to end a long time ago (more star puns coming) here comes episode 7 , the 7th entry to this franchise that seems to be having a mixed opinion amongst it's viewers. Before starting up with this review let me be really clear about the fact , that the force is strong with this one , and we are back in to the good ol' Star wars. This movie is definitely not the best star wars movie made, but it isn't a movie worth slashes of 1 and 2 ratings either. And in this review I will explain and justify my opinion with absolutely no spoilers.1)Story :- It is apparent and absolutely obvious , that most of the concerns that people have with this movie , is the fact that this is a re-hash or re-telling of episode 5 – a new hope. While that is probably a good way to explain the story, I believe that force awakens has a plot that rises way above that assumption. Now the first 10 minutes of this movie might feel extremely and creepily similar to a new hope with a lot of recurring events , but a whole new setting and a whole new motivation for both new and returning characters make this movie a surprisingly different story telling experience , with obviously lot of notable flaws. One of the biggest concerns I have with this movie is the now obvious presence of a yet another death star. But on my second viewing it is pretty much apparent that a new death star like object was a necessary plot device used by JJ Abrams to actually bind the team to fight against an actual threat to the galaxy. Not just that , the story being written by a fan and not the creationist , opens varied opportunities to add elements to the plot that not just benefit the viewer on an artistic level , but makes the world feel more burst out with familiar details and focused lore building ideas. The story does a fantastic job in slowly carrying in the new cast to hold the franchise for it's future releases , and is a great and exciting start to the now post Lucas trilogy , and feels like this movie was made and tailored perfectly for a new generation of star wars fans.2)Casting and Characters :- Now bringing in the old cast and crew into the story was a bold and perfect choice , as we know exactly how a star wars movie devoid of the original cast strength faired amongst the audience. While the performances of the returning cast is superb as usual , what really caught my eye was the new team. Daisy Ridley as Rey , John Boyega as Finn and Adam Driver as Kylo Ren and also my favorite Poe played by Oscar Isaac were all brilliant with the character that they portrayed on screen. The 1000 word limit and the presence of some serious spoilers really restrict me from over explaining these characters , but I am sure that every viewer would love the way these new characters take up and share screen space during the entire runtime of this movie. Now moving on to the returning cast , the only 2 people that really stood out was Han Solo and Chewbacca. These 2 people were not just phoned into the script for some nostalgic run but actually stood by the new generation to take them around the world of star wars and show them the galaxy far far away. Han Solo acts as the bridge between the old and new generation and is Han Solo at his best. Not to worry though , this is not the case of Crystal Skull. Lupita was good with the role that was given to her too acting as Maz Kanata. And finally do not expect much from Captain Phasma or Supreme Leader Snoke as these are characters that were just introduced into the plot and hopefully will be used responsibly in the future movies. While many of the side characters did not receive justifiable screen time , it is to rightfully experience and develop the characters of the new generation that will potentially lead the franchise for the next 2 movies of this trilogy. On a whole , both the returning and the new cast gel well to provide an all good performance to make us feel like we are back home.3)Direction:- What I was extremely scared about when I heard JJ Abrams was the director of this movie was that he might Abrafy this movie with quick cuts , shaky cams and lens flare. But the first 10 minutes of this movie provided me with some much needed re- assurance. JJ Abrams directs some beautiful set-pieces, and this movie does not lack that. There are plenty of wide shots with the sky and other subtle elementary backgrounds with the proper clean and practical colour and light choices that ultimately grounds the movie to reality unlike the CGI garbage in the prequels. Also, the use of practical effects makes this movie much more real and obviously sings the song of return thus making this movie closer and closer to the masterpieces that the original movies were. A lot of modifications done by JJ Abrams to the script runs in combination with his direction and idea of the next generation of this franchise , whose take is absolutely appreciated. His direction and his keen liking of the franchise as a fan makes this movie a fan made passion project that every fan would love.Ultimately , this is a movie that is better than the trash prequels and goes way above the CGI overkill to live close with the original trilogy."
ID_100193;10;9;"It is surprising that only 10 to 12 hours of films created the giant franchise we know as Star Wars. People have been waiting for a good Star Wars story ever since Episode 6 came out 32 years ago. Fellow Star Wars fans, I am pleased to tell you, it has come. Everyone knows Star Wars is a sci-fi, action franchise, but this film is very unique for the fact that it goes much deeper. With Evil getting more and more powerful, there is drama and fighting between the characters, but that doesn't stop romance from sneaking in with a little bit of comedy. Granted, I was worried it would turn into a kid's comedy, but quite a few times I found my self thinking that not only are the jokes perfect, they are also not over used! Alright, let's get to the part everyone wants to read, the plot of the most hyped, but hidden film of the decade. The events start out 20 years after what took place in Episode 6, (spoiler alert for people who didn't see episode 6). The Empire has fallen, yes, but a new Evil has risen, known as The First Order. The rebellion needs new Jedi now more than ever, but Luke (Mark Hamill) is missing and they need to find (wait for it) a new hope! Is the film worth the wait? Ever since almost a year ago, people have been talking about new Star Wars episode, and it is SO worth it. Famous directors have taken on some great challenges before, including Spielberg finishing Kubrick's AI. But J.J. Abrams took on something completely out of the ball field trying to continue Star Wars. The cinematography is spectacular, the ending shot (no spoiler) is one of the greatest endings I have ever seen in a film, and the whole story itself is unexpected and very enjoyable. Although there are many aspects that are not in the original Star Wars films, I think it is actually very nice to see Star Wars not get ruined, but go through its own evolving evolution. As for the acting, of course, the original A-Team - Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher and more – are phenomenal and I think it was the perfect idea to bring these characters back for the pure enjoyment of long standing fans. However, it is really Daisy Ridley who steals the show. Her character, Rey, is so fresh and unique, full of emotion, and this character (still no spoilers, sorry) goes through so much drama in the film. It must have been a very hard role to play. Daisy gives it 110%. I predict she will be win an Oscar nomination for this role. The special effects obviously got better since the last Star Wars film in the early 2000s, and I still want to mention how breathtaking they are. Even for 2015, with all the CGI aliens, ships and spectacular space scenes, it is quite literally ""eye candy."" My only criticism of the film is that it is a bit too long. However, not one single scene is out of place or feels unneeded. One of my favorite scenes is when we are reunited with Hollywood's favorite space ship. Rey and Finn (John Boyega) are trying to escape The First Order. They have two options for space flight, a ""piece of junk"" or another space ship. Well, the space ship gets blown up and it turns out the ""piece of junk"" is the millennium falcon! Of course, everyone cheers, claps and whistles in the audience once the camera shows the breathtaking ship. It is not only enjoyable, and a bit funny, but the camera technique is perfect. If you want to know the rest of the story, go get your tickets and watch the film! This film is actually pretty mature. It isn't as kind as episodes 1, 2 and 3. It has its violence, so I recommend it for ages ten to eighteen. And, adults who saw previous Star Wars films and appreciate them will enjoy this film as well. I give it five out of five stars, because, even if it is a little bit boring in the middle, (it is 2 hours and 10 minutes long) J.J. Abrams, the cast and crew achieved the impossible and created a new masterpiece that can be proudly added to the Star Wars franchise. I am also glad to say that, for the first time in over 20 years, Star Wars returns! You can see Star Wars: The Force Awakens in theaters starting December 18th! Reviewed by Gerry O., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic."
ID_100194;8;10;"Few franchises are as cherished and as glorious as Star Wars. Since its release in 1977, it has been passed down by hardcore fans to their children in the form of repeated viewings on VHS or DVD like a precious family heirloom, or has simply found itself etched in a young child's mind with no help from their parents. My generation endured the often tarnished prequels, but even if you're somebody who despises the franchise's prequels and embraces ""the original trilogy,"" think about that; you dislike one-half of the series, but you still have the nerve to call yourself a Star Wars fan. That's because the Star Wars characters, universe, and experience transcends a few subpar films; it's something that reminds us why we go see films in the first place and how they can completely transport us out of our element for an experience that we'll always hold dear to our hearts and cherish until we pass.There will undoubtedly be people quick to praise Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens as the best film in the series, or even second to The Empire Strikes Back, and there will be the hardcore fans that will simply not allow themselves to enjoy it for whatever reasons exist under the sun. For me, as a casual fan of the franchise, I wanted a compelling cast of new characters, the same kind of enriching and unique environments I had been graced with in prior installments, a desire on the screenwriters' behalf to propel things forward and not dwell on nostalgia and past events, and offer up some new thrills in a modern, but classic package.If you go into Star Wars: The Force Awakens expecting that, I'm convinced you will get it and emerge satisfied. The film may not have the kind of warmth and tingly feelings you got when you first witnessed the original Star Wars film in the theaters, on VHS, or in one of its theatrical re-releases. Through a lens that packs confidence and lacks flare, J.J. Abrams continues the franchise in a respectful and commendable way.To keep the plot's description as vague as possible, the film takes place roughly thirty years after the events of Return of the Jedi, where Luke Skywalker has disappeared and the galaxy is left dominated by the First Order, the successor to the Galactic Empire, and the Resistance, both trying to find Luke's whereabouts. We focus on a Stormtrooper nicknamed Finn (John Boyega), who escapes the First Order with a Resistance pilot named Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac), along with BB-8, a small, round droid. Their ultimate goal is to destroy the First Order, which is commanded by Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), who uses the dark side of the force to command and conquer. Later in the film, Finn teams up with a scavenger named Rey (Daisy Ridley), in addition to both Han Solo (Harrison Ford reprising his iconic role) and Chewbacca in efforts to defeat Ren and take back the Galactic Empire.To begin with, in an effort most likely geared to try to disassociate this project from the often tarnished prequels, Abrams takes the safe route in structuring The Force Awakens's narrative in a manner very similar to A New Hope. The chronological events of attacks, character development and introductions, and cause-and-effect relationships all mirror the film that started it all, and this isn't a bad thing, frankly. To try and hatch a new experimental structure to a film that's already going to be approached very cautiously by fans who are fearful of the Disney brand now stamped on all future Star Wars projects and products is a very risky move, and Abrams does a great job at playing safe, yet still delivering.This isn't to say that Abrams and his cowriters Lawrence Kasdan and Michael Arndt cling to a railing for support and safety the entire time; in fact, making the leading male in the film black and the other lead a woman is a high-point for the film, especially given how engaging these characters are. Boyega gives one of the most naturally charismatic and engaging performances I've yet to see in a Star Wars film, full of energy and not one-liners or quips that distract from the story at hand. Ridley, too, finds herself being a very believable presence, especially when tasked with carrying much of the emotional weight in the last act. Finally, let's not sleep on Oscar Isaac, who, this year alone, has had performances range from business tycoons, laidback but sinister scientists, and now a key role in one of the most renowned franchises in history. As with nearly every project he has been in, don't sleep on him here, either.Star Wars: The Force Awakens, in addition to being the best-acted installment of the original franchise, also happens to be one of the most exhilarating action spectacles of the year. With the effects being delightful blends of CGI and practical effects, the feel the film carries throughout mixes the old and the new with great results. The film doesn't bear the laborious and often artificial looks of recent blockbusters like Godzilla or Jurassic World, but it doesn't look poorly or inexpensively assembled either. This is an incomparably detailed film, especially during the first hour, when it's essentially the best sound and lights show you could ask for.I came for an experience and I was wholly satisfied having witnessed what I did before I walked out. This is a film that will likely inspire and captivate a good majority of its audience, and remind them why they love films in the first place. It's a lovely blend of old and new that doesn't rely on nostalgia to carry its story, and offers viewers a new breed of likable souls to carry this franchise to galaxies even farther and farther away, perhaps next time to uncharted territory."
ID_100195;2;10;It's an awful film, I'm just giving it a 2 because it actually had a beginning, a middle and an end.I haven't watched any of the Star Wars movies. This was my first.Objectively, as a movie, this was exactly like any of the recent blockbusters I've wasted my money on the last decade.Vehicles chasing each other and blowing stuff up, villains unable to find the target, actions that defy all laws of physics, cliché dialogue with no depth and stupid one-liners, and basically a film designed for IQ's anywhere between 0 and 50.If there was a unique story behind all this, I failed to see it.This film was plain bad.8.7Really IMDb? Really??
ID_100197;10;10;"Kathleen Kennedy and JJ Abrams have delivered the best Star Wars movie since Return of the Jedi, and it may be the best one ever. This is the Star Wars movie fans in 2015 have longed for.All of the actors knocked it out of the park. Daisy Ridley was wonderful as the lead. John Boyega had a great mix of confidence and reluctance. I wasn't expecting to care much for Oscar Isaac's character, but I was pleasantly surprised at how likable he was.Adam Driver: wow! I loved the inner conflict he brought. The fact that he lost his temper a couple of times was great. You feel like anything is possible with a villain like that. Unlike Hayden Christiansen who came across as a whiny, baby in the prequels, Driver plays it wonderfully.This movie had the perfect blend of drama, humor, and action. The humor was more in line with the original trilogy, but slightly updated for a modern age. The action was the same as the humor in that it felt like the original trilogy but was slightly updated; there were some great action shots like the Millennium Falcon grazing the sand during takeoff on Jakku and the turnaround the Falcon made just before it went into the exhaust port on an old Imperial ship.I have so many thoughts about this movie, and I can probably articulate them more completely after I've had a second viewing. For now, I'll just say that Star Wars is back, and not in the sad, pathetic way it was back in 1999, 2002, and 2005; I mean it is really back!"
ID_100198;9;10;I was so excited when the prequels came, having always loved the original trilogy. I was a bit disappointed with them, but still enjoyed them. This movie brought back the magic of the originals, with a fresh cast and goosebumps at the returning characters. Not a perfect movie, but an awesome and welcome edition to the saga!
ID_100199;10;9;So, my daughter and I just came out of Star Wars. My short summary is it is a perfect mix of old and new, and an excellent movie, probably one of the top 10 movies I've seen in 5 years or more.I'm not sure what those who gave this 1 to 7 stars are thinking, it is FAR better than your average movie. Of course it was going to have throwbacks to the others, heck, it has several of the same characters in starring roles. I also thought the new characters were outstanding, especially Daisy Ridley as Rey. I don't want to give a play-by-play analysis of the movie, just that JJ Abrams is truly a great director, the movie is beautiful, the story is engrossing, sets are amazing, and the overall pace and feel of the movie is top notch! Does the movie feel familiar....well yes of course it does, because IT IS a Star Wars movie, and yes, it has some similar scenes to the other movies. That is a GOOD thing, and they are very well done, and the humor is very well done, but not overly done or corny. Again, the movie is a wonderful blend of everything good about Star Wars. I've noticed over the last 20-30 years, especially in the last 10, there is a percentage of the USA population that is so cynical and negative about EVERYTHING! Those people will never be happy, I see it all the time in movie reviews that are so ridiculously over hyper-critical, I see it life everyday. My advice to those people is to chill, relax, sit back, and smell the roses....try to enjoy life! Star Wars: The Force Awakens IS the real deal.
ID_100200;9;10;"Often, being an artist who creates something immensely popular is a tricky situation. A work of art, like a certain movie that a young twenty-something director by the name of George Lucas created in 1974, merges with the public consciousness and becomes part of the Zeitgeist. The problem is, artists are human beings. They grow and change and the way they see the world changes. But their art is frozen in time, a ""finished"" product that endures in peoples minds. Given sufficient time between their works, artists who come back to earlier projects have very different views, and that is reflected in their work.Fans, on the other hand, still remember and idolize the original works locked in the time when they grew to love them. When they hear that the artist is producing something new they want and expect a new work that brings them back to who they were when they fell in love with the original.Which brought us to Star Wars episodes I, II, and III. I think it would be fair to say a lot of fans were unhappy with, or at least less than thrilled with, those movies. The movies reflected Lucas' vision of his universe through his eyes twenty some years after he made the first trilogy, and it was different than what fans fell in love with.But for this new trilogy Lucas stepped aside to let a fan create the next chapter of his creation. J.J. Abrams grew up as a fan of the original three films like the rest of us and his work shows it. The new movie is very similar in themes and tone to the original works. Abrams eschews growth for comfort. If he was a chef it would be like forgoing a menu built by practicing molecular gastronomy for a menu with just perfect pizzas. I don't mean this as a knock at all; sometimes all you want is a great slice, and that's what Abrams has made. A perfect slice of the themes and visuals from the original trilogy.Daisy Ridley steps into Mark Hamill's shoes as the child about to start their journey into adulthood (and the force) very capably. With all respect to Mr Hamill, I would venture to say she is at least as capable an actor as he was when he held the role. Mr. Boyega, whom I see as spiritually stepping into the role of Han Solo, does a decent job, although maybe with just a touch less charisma than Ford in the originals, in my opinion.Adam Driver does an excellent job filling the role of villain, portraying a juvenile arrogance mixed with a juvenile insecurity and impulsiveness wrapped around a despicable earnestness in his adoration of evil.And finally, as in the original films, the droids play a strong role. BB-8 is amazing as the cool robot that you wish you could own with the adorable personality of a puppy. They provide comic relief during tense moments and express the audience's emotions during the tragic ones.Just for the sake of brevity I will say that the rest of the cast was excellent as well. With the exception of Oscar Isaac portraying the fighter pilot Poe Dameron and Harrison Ford reprising his original role, their roles were much more limited, but what screen time they did get was well done.So to sum it all up, this is the perfect film for fans of the original trilogy. With tons of references and call-backs to the originals, it will have everything you are looking for, done well and with a lot of heart. If you loved the original Star Wars, you will love this one as well. And if you are too young to have started with the original trilogy, this film is a great place to start a new love affair."
ID_100201;9;10;After a really long decade Star Wars is back! J.J. Abrams has done us proud. The Force Awakens, or episode VII (the first in a new trilogy of films to come every other year) as it's been named, is a superb science-fiction film. For the die-hard fans its only gripe is it's a little too familiar in territory, but that's genuinely it. For the newer, younger audiences, TFA leads a path to what's to come. When the blue letters 'A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away' followed by the trademark yellow words swiping up the starry backdrop, I felt like I was 11 again. There's a strong scent of nostalgia mixed in to the story, but for every old memory there's 10 new ones. So many emotions washed through me within a short space of time, as I know my expectations (and everyone else's) are, and were, going to be met. It only takes a few seconds to know we're in the capable hands of someone who's a major fan himself.Now briefly on to what he's given us. The light side hangs in the balance. The forces of darkness, now known as the First Order, are stronger, bigger, more formidable than ever before. Characters on either side are equal throughout. TFA opens up the SW universe. Jakku's desert looks splendid, derelict AT-AT walkers and Star Destroyers are left abandoned and new arrivals provide different personalities that I want to know so much more about. Adam Driver's Kylo Ren switches from intimidating foe to deeply torn adolescent. All five main newbies (Isaac's fighter pilot Poe, Ridley's feisty girl Ray, Boyega's runaway Fin, Gleeson's evil man Snoke and Driver's Sith) get there chance to shine, just as the older ones so dear to me do as well. I'm eager to see The Force Awakens again, and even more for the next chapter. Episode VII will keep me feeling happy and young for a long time after its release. Next up, a spin-off called Rogue One!
ID_100202;8;10;"...he'll want to smash the prequels with a large sledgehammer. If he's honest about his work, that is. Now he has the time because he's not involved in Star Wars fist hand... and ostensibly enough money to buy an appropriately large devastating device.Seeing this made me wish I never laid my eyes on the ""CGI, pseudoscience and politics masturbation"" that were the so called prequels. Because ""The Force Awakens"" is back to the roots for the franchise. There is the sense of adventure again, there is the sense of scope and the convincing journey from small to great for the main character. It also looks like the film again, not like a televised theater. Thanks to Mr. Abrams and the crew, they didn't let down by any means! The lengths they went to to make this as meaty and good and ""starwars-ish"" as it once used to be are obvious and only the most jaded fans, ""traumatized"" by recent experiences and firmly entrenched in their own preconceptions of what ""their"" franchise should be will disagree.After scanning through some reviews here on IMDb, I can see that there are quite a lot of disappointed folks. Two main objections to the new film is that it's derivative (""ripoff"") and that it has many illogical plot points (""stupid""). Well, excuse me, people, what show are we talking about? Show me one single episode of the ""Star Wars"" franchise that isn't both a ripoff and stupid, including the first one (or ""fourth"", if you will)! All are, but that fact didn't take anything off of the pleasure of seeing them until Mr. Lucas went overboard with his out-of-touch ideas of where to take the story next. It just goes to show that you can never please everyone, especially people who got exactly what they wanted but are so used to complaining by now that complaining entertains them more than the film itself.In a way, this new outing does feel like ""the best of Star Wars"" compilation and it does feel like retelling of ""A New Hope"" with some elements from ""Empire Strikes Back"" and ""Return of the Jedi"". However, Lucas himself had this concept of the trilogies ""rhyming with each other"" which makes it legitimate and it seems that the crew honored it well here. But there is a bigger purpose to that, because if this franchise is to be reinvigorated for a long period of time it has to put a firm statement of where it stands compared to the legacy. And the statement is ""we're putting it back where it was when people were genuinely attracted to the whole thing"". This is allowed by the position of this episode in the general timeline and made possible by the sure hand of a director that knows film-making inside out and is also clearly a fan.And obviously, since new people do bring new ideas, many things from the lore are rethought and revised in a very refreshing way, and while you may not find it in the storyline, you'll certainly find it in little amusing details, my favorite being the scene where the new main villain has a fit of rage and his underlings quietly avoid him until he settles down. Yes, that's right: the characters finally feel like human beings again.Is this all good for the future of ""Star Wars""? In this age of remakes, sequels and reboots this franchise isn't a vanguard anymore and can't really open new frontiers. It now has to compete for the middle ground with a fiercely stiff competition. And despite its zealous following, I believe that ordinary audience sees it by now as something of a relic from a bygone era. Taking this as an advantage, and making it look and feel like it used to be, and refreshing it where it was needed, could be a good way to not only set it apart from other blockbusters but to retain respect for something that once made a profound cultural impact, and the production took solid steps in that direction. So, yeah, it's like restoration of a vintage car. And it works and it will still roll for quite some time.All in all, ""Star Wars"" is really back. Back with all its poignance and back with all its silliness. And they do look good! I take two marks off of ten because... well, because it's ""Star Wars""! It's my own thing, don't be bothered by it. I lost the taste for them a long time ago in a childhood far, far away. But I do admit that something in this made me feel like looking forward to sequels just like I did after I saw ""Episode V"" in cinema at the tender age of six."
ID_100203;6;10;Alright, I would like to compare it to the original Lucas trilogy. Youngsters might find this movie very entertaining if they have not watched those old good movies. However, the older audience who ever watched the 1977, 1980 & 1983 movies would have much higher expectations. Plot: This move has nothing much to add to the 3 originals. Repeating the same old story. Only few twists, but let's not spoil them here.Special effects: The BB-8 droid is the greatest part in the entire movie. It is deserved to be called the lead character. All other space ships and fighters are getting old and boring. Same old TIE fighters and X-Wings.Cast: Good to see many of the old crew back in the movie.Overall: Fine for wasting some time, hanging out with youngsters to watch the movie together.
ID_100204;9;7;"One can only have deep respect and admiration for a genius individual like J.J. Abrams I think one of the most difficult things to accomplish in the film industry is to revive a legendary and immeasurably popular franchise, but Abrams achieved in doing so not just once – with ""Star Trek"" – but now twice, with the even more astounding new ""Star Wars"" installment. ""Star Trek"" and ""Star Wars"" aren't just your average type of successful Sci-Fi movies, no, they became so humongous that they became immortal cult phenomena with millions of obsessive fans, countless of spin-offs and imitations and merchandising business that started to lead a life of their own. In order to appeal to this many skeptical and demanding fans, your film just has to be really, REALLY good! ""Episode VII: The Force Awakens"" is a fantastic film, and even though I'm not an avid ""Star Wars"" admirer, it was the first one since ""The Empire Strikes Back"" that truly impressed and overwhelmed me. Episodes I, II and III, that were released between 1999 and 2005 and directed by George Lucas himself, were not exactly worshiped by the die-hard SW-fans. Arguably that's because Mr. Lucas wrote and directed the prequels from a creator's point of view and not enough from a fan-boy's perspective. Abrams clearly is a big fan of the saga and probably knows more about Lucas' creation than he does himself, and that makes him the ideal person to helm the next generation of Star Wars cinema. ""The Force Awakens"" has a solid and absorbing scenario, breathtaking decors and set-pieces, spectacular action scenes (brought to an even higher level of awesomeness thanks to the exquisite 3D) and – perhaps the most important of all – a truly excellent and versatile cast of characters. First and foremost there's the return of some legendary heroes, of course, like Han Solo and Chewbacca, but also the newly introduced protagonists are fascinating characters. Personally, I've always been most attracted to the Dark Side, so I adored the new and powerful foe Kylo Ren (and particularly his private mental battle), the relentless army General Hux and the rather disturbing Supreme Leader Snoke. But also the good guys are extremely likable, like tough girl Rey and the reshaped Stormtrooper Finn. I can't wait for episodes 8 and 9!"
ID_100205;6;10;"Story: the script written by Abraams himself along with Lawrence Kasdan (who co-wrote ""Empire"" and ""Jedi"") is a solid block of fan service towards Episode IV. It follows identical story patterns - desert planet, kid ready to go off on adventure, mentor comes along the way,etc - but some nice (humorous) twists left and right. Although it delivers with no cringe-worthy scenes, Abraams seems to be focused too much in ""New Hope"" as he tries avoid the (hilarious) wrath of the internet fan boys. Whereas this is not necessarily a bad decision, it would be been a greater challenge to try to distinguish his film from old ties and allow himself to follow our (old and new) heroes in different settings rather than familiar ones. Of course, this is Star Wars, it had never been about breaking the rules or groundbreaking story material, it is all about family relationships. Themes: The character interaction is worth the price of the admission alone and it is simply magical to see all those icons that you love talking to each. Main focus here remains the connections between them and the family ties that each one may carry on their shoulders. It had always been a eye catching dynamic that has been explored in the last six films successfully - how Luke reacts to his father's news, how Anakin is going to save Padme, etc - and if it is not broken why fix it? Abraams knows he has a goldmine of characters the audience is willing to see in action surrounded by love, betrayal, friendship, care and heroism and commits rightfully so.Characters: Episode VII boasts a phenomenal cast - from the main protagonist duo to the film's primary villain. It's a pleasure to have Harrison Ford back as Han Solo with the most scene stealing moments and his chemistry with Fisher and Mayhew (Chewbacca) still holds strong since 1983. It is evident that Ford is having a blast at the iconic role and it seems that it has not passed a day since the concluding events of the ""Return of the Jedi"". Carrie Fisher has little screen time (unexpectedly) but does justice to the material and regarding Mark Hamill's appearance much cannot be said without giving anything away. Among the newcomers, Daisy Ridley makes a strong impact - likable, fierce and vulnerable - she brings a freshness to the Star Wars myths by being almost at the center of the story in a rather dominant boy- ish series. John Boyega is surprisingly charismatic (and amps the humor to 11!) although his character is rather blunt sometimes and feels like filler. Other wellknown cast members are either minimized cameos - Max Von Sydow, Gwendoline Christie come to mind, what a waste!, or glorified ones - looking at you Oscar Isaac. and this is where the film mostly crumbles. An overabundance of characters offer almost nothing at the proceedings instead they are used as an excuse to move the plot forward. It is admirable that Abraams tries to recreate a vivid world of Star Wars but at one point, we are not caring for most of them as they carry almost no significance or dramatic weight.Villain: The best element in the film, main player here is Kylo Ren portrayed by Adam Driver. A rather menacing (and badass) presence, his story arc is by far the most interesting with some nifty emotional touches. Driver plays Ren's obsession/confusion to perfection and surely has the most development in the movie. Not only, he summarizes what is wrong with the dark side, tiny little details regarding his emotional attributes build up his character without requiring much heavy handed exposition or long monologues. At this part, Abraams and Co have succeeded tremendously and Driver's performance carries a dramatic (and tragic) weight reminding the glory of ""Revenge of the Sith""'s final act.Direction: Abraams' direction is solid, dynamic and evidently from the Star Trek entries serviceable with similar blended display of CGI and practical effects. However, despite the presence of some inspiring dog fight sequences, Abraams seems to struggle with the lightsaber battle suffering from close ups and intense edit despite the atmospheric setting. It is always good to see no lens flare! - thank you for that - and him trying to keep consistent with the visual flare of the previous films. Following George Lucas's directing (and static) style with a bit of more dramatic movement in the space scenes feels like a natural evolution for a modern entry in the SW canon. Particularly, there is a wonderful shot of Finn fighting his way through a Stormtrooper squad while on the background Dameron is blasting lasers on Tie-fighters. Brilliant. however, it does not bring back any memorable moments due to his insistence to follow the patterns of Episode IV. Although there is a clear enthusiasm, he gets caught in his own excitement to recreate probably his nostalgia. All six films boasted some truly memorable set pieces (Vader vs Luke in Empire, Duel of the fates scene, pd race, Emperor confrontation in Jedi) or visual style (who can forget the almost renaissance like lava landscapes of Mustafar?), yet here, despite the state of the art talent involved, the films feels more a fan service checklist rather than a fully fleshed out adventure.Despite being a technical thrill and a treat for the holiday season, Episode VII though lacks any emotional punch while it is focused on pulling off the nostalgia flag rather than initiate excitement with something new. Abraams has done a serviceable job as the franchise's first helmer with adequate action scenes and a great cast. He falls short though as he sidelines interesting personalities, events and mini plots threads at the expense of the fan service with a blink and you miss ending that sets up further entries."
ID_100206;10;9;The amount of negative reviews that are out there are simply hilarious. What were the mom's basement trolls looking for in the movie, a complete exposition of the 30 years that have passed since Return of the Jedi? If you were expecting that, then we would have a 9 hour plus movie.In this latest installment history always repeats itself, with the adage if it did work the last time then lets build a bigger one. Only to find out that it will only fail. Remember that this is the start of the 3rd trilogy, and the introduction of new characters, plots and worlds must take place in the first act, if you don't, then you will not know what's going on in all the other installments!Solid script, direction, story, production and especially the soundtrack. It is easier to be negative than to be positive and those that write negative reviews are only looking for their 15 minutes of 'fame'This movie is perfect, end of story. 5/5 stars
ID_100207;6;9;Watched the movie twice.I really tried to like it and find something at least half great as the advertising campaign behind it.The story might keep you interested although it's a recycled one.Its connections and references to the old movies take the spotlight in front of the narration.Sadly, this movie is not about its story.It's about its characters. Sadly(again), its characters are very weak in their construction.I understand that some of them can have a weak back story,or no back story at all but when you have a movie like this one on your hands though,you need to treat your characters with more respect.And your audience.Some of us are not willing to wait for another movie to find out who are they. No glimpse of their past,their motivation or purpose.Everything the two main characters do is forced out of their nature and context.The only one that is believable is the antagonist. He is the only one that has a clear reason to be in this movie and he seems quite determined to show it. He gets his motivation from Vader, whom he admires and reaches out to. We don't know all of his back story, but we understand that he was not like that from the beginning.You won't get an explanation for the strange light-saber from the trailer though.I'm sure everybody likes the music from Star Wars.I was glad to find out they got the same John Williams to do the soundtrack.In the theater I was disappointed to hear music on 85% of the movie.Excess is a trademark of bad taste.The music is very good, but it was too much for me and it had an unexpected effect.During one battle on a planet, there is no music.The sound design from that sequence might not be that bad, but when you play music from frame one till the end and leave a moment like that not covered by Williams,that moment seems much more weaker and the sound design really poor. I understood why they did it that way.It marks a moment when a character sees the other(at least for a long time), but doing it like this shows that Jar-Jar Abrams is a mediocre film school student director at best. There are more appealing ways to treat a moment like that one.He chose the least creative one and the safest way.Overall the movie is a safe-bet.People will like it although it's not groundbreaking.It's not even going in a slightly different direction.Star Wars has some good moments.I won't take those away from the movie.I enjoyed the action sequences.Fast paced editing, lots of tension and twists.They seem a bit singular in the whole context but they worked.The thing that bugged me were the jokes...the Disney Effect.I did not feel in the mood for small humor in a Star Wars movie.Han Solo made jokes in the old movies,but it was part of his character.Here, everybody has a small moment of cheap humor.Instant turn off.I don't know what I expected from a Star Wars movie directed by Abrams(several of his trademarks are here).I don't like his movies,and I'm sure that whatever I wanted from this movie, I did not get it.Just don't expect to see a masterpiece.
ID_100208;4;7;"Never understood why the new Star Wars trilogy got so much hate from the fandom, but after I rewatched all previous chapters (including Rogue One), I can understand why people that follows this saga since the beginning were so hard with it.First of all, the main villain is not credible at all. Beating Darth Vater for charisma is impossible, he will always be one of the best villain in cinema, but screenwriters could come up with something better than a crying kid that does not know what he wants. I never felt scared by Kylo Ren, and the overall interpretation is awful. Adam Driver, which a really good actor, does what he can, but I think that the main issue is on how the character was developed in the first place on the screenplay.We know since the beginning that a new order is risen from the ashes of the old empire, but during the movie there are too many missing information. You cannot really understand how this new dark side originated, where some important characters come from. Everything is very confusing and even if I have watched the entire saga, it feels like I have skipped a chapter of Star Wars.The movie is way too long, and filled with useless scenes. Too much cringey humor, Disney is very good to create ""comedic"" moments where is not needed. CGI is good, nothing to say, but this does not compensate the overall disappointment. They should have ended the saga with Episode VI."
ID_100209;7;3;Star Wars: The Force Awakens (2015) *** (out of 4) I'm pretty sure every person on Earth know what the film is about and just in case you don't I'm not going to spoil anything here in regards to the plot. Yes, it's basically a reworking of A NEW HOPE with the old and new characters being brought together to go up against the Dark Side.STAR WARS: THE FORCE AWAKENS was probably the most anticipated movie in recent memory and as no shocked it turned out to be a massive hit. I predicted when I heard that it was going to be made that it would eventually become the top grossing movie ever made. It hasn't quite reached that mark as of me writing this but I'm sure it will happen. So, we know it was a massive hit but how was the actual movie? I'm not a major STAR WARS fan but this one here isn't nearly as good as episodes four through six. How could it be? With that said I must admit that I found the film to be extremely entertaining, which is all I was personally asking for. I thought J.J. Abrams did a very good job at building up the new characters and the new story while also keeping the original trilogy fans happy. I thought the screenplay was clever in how the old characters were brought into this new story and I won't complain about any of the events that happen in regards to the story.The special effects, as you'd expect, are spectacular and they certainly push the level in regards to what can be done today. The various space battles were tremendous to look at and best of all is that they feel 100% authentic and real. There wasn't a single battle where you didn't feel as if you were right there in the action and this is always a major plus. Another thing are that the robotic characters are all well-designed and manage to fit right in with the series. The film is full of wonderful action scenes and all of them are full of terrific atmosphere.Performance wise, against I'm not going to spoil anything major so all I will say is that the original three actors are all excellent in how they are used. The new people like Daisy Ridley, JOhn Boyega, Oscar Isaac and Adam Driver all are good and I think fans have a nice cast to take this series into the future. Of course, we also have Chewbacca back, which is always fun.The film does have some flaws and I think some of it is based around the humor. The film goes for a lot of humor and I thought a lot of it didn't work all that well. Ford and Chewbacca get some nice moments together but many times the jokes fell flat. I'd also say that the film ran on a tad bit too long but the ending was so wonderful that it was fun once it came. STAR WARS: THE FORCE AWAKENS is really just a set-up for what's to follow and it certainly has me excited for what comes next.
ID_100211;10;9;I just recently re-watched it force awakens and honestly the criticisms of the film are just bull crap specially the whole thing that feels like a new hope. It feels more like return of the Jedi but even then it's just a Star Wars movie it's ambition's the only criticism that really works is that sometimes it's to safe but it's really ambitious.sometimes people seem to forgot tiny details especially about things that don't match with there bias/head canon. There's like a lot foreshadowing people miss especially with snoke like most theories that are about him were trash . A great start to a good/great trilogy.
ID_100212;9;8;A lot of people complained about the similarities between this and the original but I thought it was kind of a fun ode but still its own sort of thing. After seeing the horrifically awful Last Jedi I think we can all agree this one looks even better in retrospect. JJ Abrams clearly loves it and you can feel that and I think it's pretty great.
ID_100213;6;9;I will tell you what I liked, didn't like and then talk spoilers in this order. The force has definitely been awakened and yes you will feel it in the theatre. I was clapping and cheering, people were doing it and you will too. I absolutely loved the new characters Fin, Kylo Ren and Rey. My favourite was Rey but I'm sure everyone will have their own favourite out of the trio. The other character I liked was Snoke and the New order commander. It is hard to make new characters extremely likable especially with the previous legendary cast being around but they did it. There is a surprisingly big amount of comedy in this film and I found myself laughing a lot. Obviously we know the old cast are in the movie and they do not disappoint (with minor exception that does not apply). Han solo was Han damn Solo and that was amazing! The film has beautiful scenery and new cool creatures which is a nice addition to the Star Wars galaxy. Now by all means, going into this movie I lowered my expectations and told myself I shouldn't judge the movie negatively just because the 'old Star Wars' feeling isn't there but that is not the issue. The movie has technical issues and Star Wars related issues. The technical issues are that the film is incomplete - leaves more questions than answered and a cliffhanger. The other technical issue is the plot is too similar to previous films. The Star Wars related issues are that: there was a lack of original score for the characters which is something Star Wars always has done. Some characters have such a small average role that really makes you question all that marketing and hype behind them. There is little or no dialogue at some critical scenes which I feel like there should have been. But the main issue here is that this movie would be really good if you watch the coming episodes back to back because it feels more like a serial on Netflix and it shouldn't be like that, it should be a full movie on it's own and continue the saga in the coming episodes. Now for the ******SPOILERS******* Did I just watch an extended trailer or was that the movie?!!! The movie is too short! The shots in the trailers with the knights of Ren and Luke with R2D2 are a vision scene in the movie which last the same amount of time as in the trailers!!!!! Thats it...a few seconds!!! The new death star was amazing, it was badass it looked invincible the New Order looked like the new big thing and all of a sudden the rebels come up with a plan to blow up the death star in mere seconds send in like a few x-wings and they blow it up along with every new order on it.....um WHAT?!!! seriously?! The victory for the rebels was so unrewarding, I could not believe they actually did it all again and expected us to cheer. So many inconsistency with characters in the movie like is Fin a Jedi or not if not then how does he battle Kylo Ren so well and even injure him!!! If yes he is a Jedi, how did he learn how to use a light saber so fast and match Kylo Ren who has had training as a Jedi from Luke his uncle and as a sith from Snoke. How does Rey learn the ways of the force and so well?! Just because she is strong with the force doesn't automatically make her a master Jedi fighter! Anakin Skywalker was the strongest Force sensitive person in the galaxy and he needed years of training to match other Jedi and Sith. Rey was too powerful! To the point where did didn't make sense and you start to realize it's not supposed to because Diney is trying to make a Disney princess out of her!!! What happened to Kylo Ren?? did he survive the blast explosion of the new death star?! snoke told the commander to bring him but they never show that he survives and thats not how it should have been addressed. That is not how you do anticipation for the next film. they should have shown him flying out injured on a craft, thats it! Are they trying to make us think that he's dead and surprise us by bringing him back?! how cliché would that be!!! Captain phasma was such a disappointment because she is there just as a cameo!!! she barely has any role! They cast an amazing actress and give her an amazing look and they don't even use her, she could have playing a stormtrooper and we wouldn't have felt the difference. Luke Skywalker is NOT in the movie!!! just at the very end he turns stares into Rey and the credits role...what?! what ever happened to C3PO's hand!!!?? I thought we were gonna know!! so basically we have to watch episode 8 to see Star Wars!!! this movie was just a trailer tease for Episode 8. We still don't know if snoke is Darth Plagueis but I don't have a problem with that, he looked badass. What was all that marketing with Ray's staff?! she has it in the beginning, then doesn't have it through out the movie and then at the end she magically has it again. Is that staff something special?! they didn't tell us anything so basically all that marketing was not for this movie but the next if her staff is actually something special like light saber or Darth plagueis's Saber. You know now I question the studio for putting a sudden embargo on the reviews for the movie after the premiere. I thought they were doing that for spoilers but apparently they were doing it because they sensed bad reviews would hurt the movie.
ID_100214;8;9;Star Wars Episode VII: The Force Awakens is directed by J.J. Abrams. This film takes place over 20 years after The Return Of The Jedi. It was long awaited, but it definitely delivered. This film is everything you want a Star Wars film to be. It further deepens and gives purpose to the original characters, as well as introduces very likeable new additions. The action sequences are all incredible. This film really makes the most of modern CGI, but also does many things practically, which is essential for a Star Wars film. It is important that I speak about the new villain, Kylo Ren. This guy is awesome! He's such a deep and complex character. There is so much conflict within him, and when learning more about his back story, it makes you really view him as more than just an evil antagonist. The main criticism of the film surrounds the fact that it seems to follow and share similarities to the original trilogy, particularly A New Hope. I can see how perhaps they played it safe. But in my opinion all they did was improve on it and explore everything on a much deeper level. Star Wars: The Force Awakens contains such great writing and film making so therefore I give it a 9.
ID_100215;6;5;"OK I am a fan, but not a fanatic! to begin with, the movie is solely carried on the tiny shoulders of Daisy Ridley (Rey), the rest did not hold a candle to her (including Harrison Ford & Oscar Issac), so well done miss Ridley, you saved the movie. Special effects and action are all very good, story? well 'aaay ' acceptable - but my beef is mainly else where. I watched this movie at Empire - Leicester Sq. in London, which to my knowledge is the only IMAX-Laser theatre currently in UK. The cinema is supposed to be the state-of- the-art with 4K resolution, 3D and the latest incarnation of IMAX which uses laser- beams to create images brighter than anything before, with better contrast blah- blah. But it failed miserably! I have seen sharper & cleaner pictures from a £500 TV set, Picture was awash with dot-crawl noise, contrast was terrible, motion-judder almost made me sick, and if that was not enough, the crappy 3D-glasses were so hazy, slightest ambient light would turn them gray, destroying any blacks! the space scenes background was not black, it was an annoying gray. Do yourself a favour, watch it on 2D and don't waste your money on IMAX-laser 3D , it is just a hype. Otherwise the movie is watchable, but not great! ---------------------------UPDATE------------------------ Just watched it again on bluray release, and I haven't changed my mind. I still find it ""Not-Good-Enough"" to do justice to previous movies. They need to really concentrate on a STORY first, a movie is nothing without a proper story - re-using previous stories is no good - no matter how much you throw Special-Effects at it. StarWars did not become a classic because of it's special effects alone. Needs a better story teller (as in both writer and director)."
ID_100216;10;10;The Franchise we all know and love is back, and guess what? It's BETTER THAN THE PREQUELS! While it doesn't quite top the originals, it comes so close. The movie is so close to perfection! While many will complain the lack of screen time each character gets, everything else works out perfect! The new comers John Boyega and Daisy Ridley are near perfection. There were times when they had a few corny and unfunny lines to deliver, which did not work, but the newcomers do the best job. The casting choice in this one is way better than the prequels. J.J. Abrams does his best to make it like Star Wars and not Star Trek and i think that is what brings this movie to life in so many ways. Everything you knew of the original Star Wars has been brought back to life, and it's as if you are a child again! Sometimes you could never tell what was CGI and what was a costume. The main villain is not only different, but extremely terrifying. I will not spoil anything, but let's just say it was not what you were expecting. All in all, there are some terrific and emotional, breathtaking moments in this film that will go down in the history of the Star Wars franchise. All your favourite characters are back, and it's a breath of fresh air! I am giving this 5/5 stars. May the force be with you. -JayFor my review of The Force Awakens, I will indeed not to give away spoilers to ruin the fun and solid return to roots for the franchise but I will say what I loved about TFA.Firstly, forget the prequels that had surfaced a couple of years back and embrace the continuing saga of the Star Wars universe, taking place at least 30 years after the exciting conclusion of The Return of the Jedi. The story introduces new characters for both from the good side (New Republic) and it's foes (Galactic Empire) and brings back the iconic characters from the original trilogy, sharing some awesome scenes of emotion, full scale action set-pieces, development and even setting the tone for the future episodes VIII and IX.The acting from John Boyega, Daisy Ridley, Oscar Issac, Adam Driver, Domhnall Gleeson and such are all tops, they each give a solid treatment to their roles that enable them to develop further with the plot and set their future roles into the coming episodes.The direction is a solid job well done by J.J. Abrams, who manages to keep not only the original elements of the trilogy but gives a polished refreshing look and tone to the new trilogy that is bound to keep fans and audiences revamp their love for the franchise.Overall, this is the film that will indeed win you over again and again while being labelled as the best instalment of the series to date. Go see it not only once, but multiple times as it's worth the hype and word of mouth.5/5 - Nick
ID_100217;8;9;"Context is important to review Star Wars: The Force Awakens. The original Star Wars was an iconic movie of its time and holds fond memories for lots of people from childhood watching the movies, re-enacting the characters and playing with the action figures.As George Lucas found out with the average (at best) prequel trilogy of the late 90's and early 00's, its better not to mess with this nostalgia (recall; bad acting, annoying characters and over-use of CGI, all still fresh in peoples memories). So it was always going to be a balancing act keeping everyone happy by providing something new and fresh but not trampling on legacy and memories.And I think they managed it pretty well.In the secure hands of director J. J. Abrams (why handled the new Star Trek movies very well), we have new and interesting characters in Rey (Daisy Ridley), Poe (Oscar Isaac), Fin (John Boyega) and Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), all acted very well and creating a fresh dynamic in the story.The plot you could argue is pretty formulaic and too close to the original Star Wars, but care has obviously been taken in its making with a nod to the past with revisits of old characters (Han Solo), old equipment (Millennium Falcon) and also a revisit of original production methods, such as the use of puppets in some roles when CGI could easily have been used. To Star Wars fans these small details make a difference.A cynic would say that it is too superficial and not enough fresh ideas or depth, just a ploy to get tickets sold, but for me it was an enjoyable movie with lots of escapism and interesting scenes, great visual effects, and it really did not drag in its length.I'm not a Star Wars buff by any means, but I for one felt more than satisfied having watched this episode.8/10."
ID_100218;9;9;I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised by the film. Used to Abrams' horrid bastardizing style, I expected something fit for children and devoid of soul. But since I am not a Star Wars fan and Abrams probably is, I found it acceptable and he probably made more of an effort than when he mauled Star Trek, where the situation is clearly reversed.But what is important to understand right away is that this is not really a sequel. They spend as little time as possible tying the other six films with the story, instead focusing on specific nostalgia bringing moments and catchphrases. Other than that they just rehash Episode IV, the original first movie. It starts on a desert planet, the main character is strong with the force and is good with mechanics, the villain wears a mask and is the apprentice of an evil and ugly looking a-hole, it has a Death Star kind of thing, it is destroyed in the last moment, there are a lot of familial ties that are either pushed down your throat for no good reason of hidden away for a big reveal later on. The only thing missing is an Obi-Wan Kenobi type of guy, dispensing with the training or any kind of explanation of what is going on and replacing it with battle and explosions.Therefore, this is a clear reboot. After all Abrams does the same thing, only better because he probably care about Star Wars a little (sorry, still bitter): he takes a franchise, lists all the good and/or nostalgic points that fans love and shoves them all in his new movie, tying it all with duct tape and special effects.I thought the actors were good, including the new Vader, which some thought was too whiny. Excuse me, have you seen Anakin? Anyway, Adam Driver does a very good job of displaying flaring uncontrolled emotion while behaving in a clear psychotic way. He is not just a misguided soul torn by pain and seduced by dark power, he is clearly deranged and he portrays that very well. The new Luke is quite hot and credible, as much as the plot lets her.A disappointment is the character of Finn, who seems to jump from one personality to another with glee, his only role seemingly to bring the plot in the direction wanted, with no consideration to character consistency. I have nothing with the acting, but the character was almost JarJarish in its randomness. Also Luke...Special effects were top notch, including the battles. Gone are the incompetent stormtroopers who can't hit a target sitting in front of them. They are not competent either, but still. The 3D is also done well and didn't just jump on my face for no reason. Also Luke... (you'll get it when you see the ending of the movie)Bottom line: Abrams reboots Star Wars, trying to take credit for the good stuff others invented before him and brush under the rug the bad things that people hated. He does a reasonable enough job, but while trying to bring realism and technology to the table, he loses part of the magic that the fans were so addicted too. For Star Wars' sake, I hope the sequel will be as good as Empire Strikes back was for Star Wars, otherwise people will just be left with a childish special effect filled clone of the movie that awed their parents.
ID_100219;10;10;"I can't believe all of the negative comments coming from people reviewing this movie! As a long time fan of Star Wars, Force Awakens was everything I was hoping the Prequels could have been. In my opinion they did a great job honoring the old characters while also introducing some new and very fascinating people. The story was fun and paid homage to the original movies. To all the idiots bashing JJ Abrams, my words to you are, ""Shame on you!"" For him to take the reigns and be willing to bring the series back probably took some courage!!! Do your self a favor and go see this film. I am going to see it at least a few more times!"
ID_100220;9;10;"The saga that enthralled two generations is back to captivate the imagination of a third. A new Star Wars trilogy begins with the much discussed STAR WARS: THE FORCE AWAKENS. Since the classic trilogy, Star Wars has become synonymous with relatable characters in an old fashioned good vs evil story all set to mind blowing special effects, convention defying designs, and a rousing fanfare that kicks off each story set in that galaxy far far away.Under the masterful hand of director JJ Abrams and writer Lawrence Kasdan , THE FORCE AWAKENS pays tribute to the original classic trilogy, recreating iconic scenes, memorable lines and bringing back as many of the classic actors to reprise their roles. Some may say that it is a whole sale copy of A New Hope but there are enough differences and twists to keep things fresh. It is new enough for first time viewers yet Familiar enough without feeling like it is pandering to the existing fanbase. The balance struck is extraordinary! Actors new and old give a stellar performance. Veterans like Harrison Ford slip right back into their classic roles, completely becoming those same characters the old fans knew and loved. The new ones aren't too shabby either with John Boyega as Finn, Daisy Ridley as Rey and Oscar Issac as Poe Dameron turning in magnificently nuanced performances. These, coupled with strong writing and snappy scripting, brings back the naturalistic dialogue of A NEW HOPE, giving us characters that are easy to relate to and well fleshed out. Humour is used sparingly but effectively such that the level of tension and danger is maintained, unlike certain comic book movies where we get a laugh every 5 minutes (I'm looking at you marvel) even though the world is going to end.JJ Abrams was born to direct science fiction. Having honed his craft in two STAR TREK movies, His Free flowing filming style and Long tracking shots make every spaceship scene an exciting roller coaster ride. The audiences weave in and out of battle as gracefully as the starfighters that are blasting away at each other, they run alongside Rey and Finn as enemy TIE fighters fire on them, they are right there in the thick of the lightsaber duels. All this without resorting to the scourge of shaky-cam that so many directors tend to fall back on to ""enhance"" action. Action is large and sweeping in scale with more personal character moments filmed intimately. A balance. For every good balance dictates that there should be a bad. For every hero, a villain. The new villain of Kylo Ren is easily the weakest in the history of black clad STAR WARS antagonists, lacking the menacing presence of Darth Vader, the regal air of Count Dooku, or even manipulative cunning of Palpatine. Kylo is just one angsty angry boy who throws at least two hissy fit tantrums throughout the movie. Maybe it is my age but I find it hard to relate to him as either a tragic antagonist or the next Big bad villain. Adam Diver does his best in the role of Kylo, but he is written Less like a villain and more like an furious fanboy worshiping a famous Long dead individual.Some may not appreciate the seemingly ""safe"" route that the movie takes when it clings to the story beats and mirrors the narrative of the original trilogy. Perhaps they wanted to play it safe after the questionable critical reception of the prequels. After all, familiarity sells and so does nostalgia. The marketing team definitely did their research. I for one did not appreciate a return to the simplistic ""hero's journey"" where good is good and evil is evil. I missed the more complex themes of the prequels and the real world analogies within the narrative of the clone wars and the rise of the empire. But again, this could just be the producers playing it safe. The best part of the movie for me was not the breathtaking special effects or the acting. It was the music by veteran Composer John Williams. From the first notes of that legendary fanfare to the more quieter character centric themes, William's score retains the feel of old school space opera and never caves in to modern movie scoring conventions. He eschews the heavy drums and electronic sounds of recent blockbusters for the traditional brass, strings and woodwinds. The general tone, distinct melodies and some old favourites bring us back to an era where a movie's soundtrack is its own performance that can be enjoyed with or without the movie itself.With all the homages to the older STAR WARS movies, one can really feel that the creative team were fans themselves. That is not to say that this movie would only appeal to fans. On the contrary, it has something for everyone to love, even relative newcomers to the franchise. This is one movie that would definitely have everyone talking about it after the closing credits; reminiscing, recollecting, speculating, and waiting eagerly for the next instalment in the STAR WARS saga."
ID_100228;6;1;I just seen it in Brussels, right after work.Is this a good star wars movie? yes! Is this a good movie? yes Is this a great star wars movie? definitely yes!Is this a great movie? no, for me not!the good: i enjoyed myself quite a lot with this movie. Its clearly made by fans, for the fans. It feels and breaths star wars.The transition from 'the old' to the 21st century is definitely spot on.The acting is classes above all previous movies combined, yes including the original.I grew up with star wars, loving the movies, but unlike many(not all) fans i can be perfectly critical to the flaws of the original as well.Beyond great and by a landslide the best part of the movie was for sure, the action! the still camera's are replaced by exiting moving camera angles from all sides without ever loosing oversight. things simply looked delicious and total awesome.But since I'm not a 10 year old anymore :) I also manage to approach this in a more critical way then only the fan perspective!There were a few things disappointing to me as this is absolutely not a flawless movie. First of all, without spoilers, this movie is 60-70% just exactly like ' a new hope' strip down all nostalgia and re-introduction of the older characters and whats left of 'new story' material is really really thin, cant help it but i was disappointed about that.I understand the strong importance to connect the new to the old, but this was sometimes trying to be too much 'beying' the old to my personal sentiments. so nostalgic people will of course go nuts,crazy and in full admiration but i have honestly my doubts all adult people specially when not a star wars fan will be equally thrilled.inconsistencies: there are a few , now i know this is the first chapter of a new trilogy, and lots will still need to be explained. But despite that, there are simply a few things that doesn't make any sense at all or where a bit overly charmingly 'star wars' simplified for todays story telling standardsand then final for me the biggest disappointment was the villain!!! By seeing the trailers i had very high hopes, and having a legacy of total bad ass villains ,how could it go wrong? well asides form a few nice tricks this kylo is a total wimp, specially compared to all the previous baddies, he's without spoiling, a confused insecure teenager, struggling with himself, and not this ominous evil unstoppable powerhouse dark force. as what should be the proper decorum for being the baddie of star wars! anyway, non the less, overall, i had great fun, and i can not image star wars fans wont have. it definitely makes many of the high expectations true, and is by a landslide better then all the prequels combined. But is this the best movie I saw this year? no. but recommendable. an honest very fresh review
ID_100229;10;10;"Before going into this movie, I was a bit nervous. I did not want this film to be a bit of a disappointment like The Phantom Menace, not saying I hate that movie. After walking out of the IMAX theater, I was amazed. Star Wars Episode VII: The Force Awakens is my favorite film I have ever seen, and I have seen many of the greats. The story takes place, 30 years after the events of Return of the Jedi. The First Order, the new Galactic Empire, is looking for the map that leads to the missing Jedi Knight, Luke Skywalker, while the Resistance is trying to get it as well. First off, the casting is amazing, especially Daisy Ridley, who plays Rey. The story was great, and don't care about ""the plot being too alike to A New Hope"" because pretty much all of the Star Wars plots are like that. The characters were very well thought, especially Kylo Ren. The twist is amazing, not spoiling it. I have no negatives what so ever. Unfortunately, I can only give this film 10, and not higher. I loved it, so I saw it again in IMAX. I highly recommend this film."
ID_100230;10;9;At first I thought this movie was going be a dissapoinment and flop big time because star wars is a popular franchise movies that it's impossible to pull off, but jj Abrams proved me wrong.This movie is flat out action packed and just damn brilliantly exciting and totally awesome from start to finish, I love this movie.This movie should of given jj Abrams an oscar nomination for Best director.This movie can never be boring, it does not run-out off energy.For 135 minutes you can't feel the time.The action is pitch perfect.This is a smart clever movie for everybody but better on imax cinemas.
ID_100231;10;6;The Star Wars that we know and love is back and better than ever.
ID_100232;10;10;When you're taking on this amount of history, or baggage depending on your point of view, you have to start modest and start small and let the story slowly tell itself and fill in the gaps. That's what happens here, as we begin (not unlike SW IV) with a small droid with an important package running into some random (or are they random?) characters. I don't think it's a spoiler to say that along the way Hans Solo and Chewy join the ride and things really start to heat up. As they do the movie pays homage to previous episodes without just redoing what they did before (with one exception). Maybe it's easier just to say what it is - 1) good plot, 2) good characters, best of them Solo, 3) good dialogue, 4) an active story that moves along well, and 5) beautiful scope to the scenery and special effects. What is one of the things that made the original Star Wars so damn good? Scenes like Luke looking wistfully over the desert grandeur of Tatooine. Just reveling for a moment in the spectacle of a foreign world. We got some of that here. What it's not is 1) too over-the-top, 2) too long, or 3) too complicated. Is Abrams to blame for why this is the best SW since Empire? I suspect he is. Real real nice job.
ID_100233;8;1;"I have just come back home from the cinema after having spent the evening there with my family watching the new ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"". And I am thrilled, excited and ecstatic.There was a big hype about ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"", and you would have to be living in a cave somewhere if that had eluded you. And no wonder that there was so much hype about it, because director J.J. Abrams did have some rather big shoes to fill out after taking over from legendary George Lucas. And then just how did he manage to do? In my honest opinion, then J.J. Abrams did an amazing job, hand on heart.And having grown up with ""Star Wars"" and loving the franchise, then I was also anticipating the movie and looking forward to seeing what J.J. Abrams would bring to the table. And I think that after the last three movies - parts one, two and three - in the legacy, then it could be nothing but better. And yes, J.J. Abrams succeeded and picked up the torch nicely and continuing in the spirit of the original trilogy - parts four, five and six.Story-wise, then J.J. Abrams was working on the continuation of the last movie ""Star Wars: Return of the Jedi"", and this seventh movie was set 30 years after the defeat of the Empire and the destruction of the second Death Star; being the end of the ""Star Wars: Return of the Jedi"" movie. And while ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" boasts a completely new array of characters, then the return of the core essential characters from the original trilogy (parts four, five and six) return to part seven as well.So just how did these new characters fit into the legacy and the story that J.J. Abrams told in ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens""? Personally, I must admit that I think that the character gallery was amazing, and the talents cast to play the roles were really nicely chosen and were doing really good jobs in bringing the characters to life on the screen. Of course Luke Skywalker (played by Mark Hamill), Han Solo (played by Harrison Ford), Leia Organa (played by Carrie Fisher), C3P0 (played by Anthony Daniels), R2D2 (played by Kenny Baker) and Chewbacca (played by Peter Mayhew) need no introduction. But the new characters introduced in ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" did prove really good and had lots of variety. Rey (played by Daisy Ridley), Finn (played by John Boyega), Poe Dameron (played by Oscar Isaac) and Kylo Ren (played by Adam Driver) did prove to be good characters that will be memorable as those in the original trilogy. However, and yes there is a however, I didn't really think that the villainous Kylo Ren was all that impressive, just seemed like a cheap knock off of Darth Vader, to be honest.And while we are on the topic of the new characters, then I am excited to see the next movies and follow the stories of these newly established characters. But also to follow the continued story of the heroes from the original trilogy.The storyline told in ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" was good, and I had all my hopes and wishes fulfilled by J.J. Abrams's storytelling, and he really did a good job in continuing the timeless space saga. However, there was just too many parallels to the first movies. I mean, a galactic power force that has built a massive weapon capable of destroying planets, and a small force of opposition attempting to foil their plans. It had been done twice already, so on that account, Abrams did leave us hardcore fans with a somewhat dry sensation in our mouths. But the story told around the core characters was good, thrilling and fast-paced. And I think that he managed to incorporate a good many things and details for each individual character and tie them together nicely for a greater picture.And having the special effects team return to physical effects and not rely on CGI as they did in parts one, two and three was a good thing, because they returned to how they worked their magic in parts four, five and six. And the special effects guys really went back to the roots with lots of details, fabulous creatures, great costumes and captured that unique ""Star Wars"" sensation. And boy was that magic back with a vengeance. I was completely blown away with all the details and touches added to this movie. And the space dogfights was just exciting like you wouldn't believe. It was like you were there yourself.Yes, I am a fan of ""Star Wars"", that is no secret and no doubt about it, and it warms my heart to have this glorious return to the original trilogy, and to see it leave the work of George Lucas in parts one, two and three far, far behind in its wake.""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" is exactly what was needed to put new life into the franchise, especially after the massacre the franchise was exposed to with parts one, two and three. And on that account, then J.J. Abrams deserves a massive applause for this accomplishment with this movie. I respectfully salute thee.If you enjoy the ""Star Wars"" saga, then you should embrace ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" with open arms, because it really is a majestic return to the atmosphere and sensation of the original trilogy."
ID_100235;5;10;"My score for this film, Star Wars VII - The Force Awakens, is 5/10 maximum. Nothing is original and it is only a pale copy of the first Star Wars IV - A New Hope (1977)The special effects are decent but it almost did it. The scenarios are virtually nonexistent and the story is not new.If the first Star Wars cost $ 11 million, the latest cost 200. This is still 20 times more. Salaries of people do not have as yet increased.In addition, we went to get the fuddy-duddy Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher and Mark Hamill. This has had cost at least 20 million. It is true that on the other hand it changes nothing since in any case all this money will go directly into tax havens and that the stars and the companies attached to this film will not pay any tax as always.They ""gives"" 1 million to ""poor"" to not pay 10, 100 million or 1 billion (companies like Walt Disney) in taxes! Magnificent. We understand who make the laws and for who!No need to waste your money to see this film. The rich are rich enough even if they think otherwise (this is crazy: misers).Get this movie on forums if you really want to see. But again nothing new. Like all the movies coming out of Hollywood these past 10 years (at least) we only see special effects but for history and although they are just good for ants!"
ID_100236;10;10;i don't know where to start but all i can say that this movie was amazing and i watched for many time like 6 times and more and my family was like what the hell u only watch it and repeat it many times..soo wht can i say..love star wars and its one of my favorite movies and hope they keep making this for the next level...and
ID_100237;9;10;It's a heck of a ride! Loved how they keep the rhythm of the wow going when they keep introducing highlights. This movie has so much significance with regards to linking up from Return of the Jedi. This is easily one of the best from the original 9 movies. Perhaps my only dislike from the movie is how some pieces resemble episode 4.I don't see how you may have missed the movie till now, as it's a historical blockbuster, but if you haven't seen the movie yet, do it! Do it!
ID_100238;10;9;Cause i'm sick and tired of a few people who are bashing this movie and the prequels i want to clear that anyone who is a true fan and loves the star wars universe loves all 6 movies the same and now he loves also the new addition to the series.Part 7 is exactly what u expect to see as the dark side comes back with new villains and heroes who fit great with the old stuff we used to know.Most of the original crew is back fitting beautiful with the new crew , the cgi are great and the movie as a whole is A MASTERPIECE.Now for all the devoted fans who are connected to the story and characters u will be moved and never get enough.No spoilers at all so go watch it for the 2nd and third time in a theater and then also get the DVD // blu ray plus whatever u like from the STAR WARS memorabilia.Next year we get the first star wars spin off called rogue one and i can't wait.PS.A word of advise to the haters....bashing this movie u only make us love STAR WARS MORE AND MORE......AND MORE SO STOP ALREADY AND GO TROLLING SOMEWHERE ELSE IN THE BOARDS CAUSE ALL STAR WARS MOVIES ARE GREAT.....NOT JUST FIRST THREE.CRYSTAL LAKE CLEAR.
ID_100239;10;10;Loved it! Can't praise it enough Sat there for 2 hours like a little kid on Xmas morningThe new characters are engaging, funny, and human, something I now see that was lacking from the prequelsI'm old enough to remember seeing A New Hope at the cinema when it was first released, I came of the cinema last night with the same sense of excitement.Glad to see that its dong well, and there will be lots more to come I see sadly there are a few folks on this list trolling the film, you guys need to let go of your hate, life is short, you're supposed to suspend your disbelief, let go of your cynicism, and simply enjoy yourself, because if you let this film take you in, its simply stunning.....exciting and emotional...pure good old fashioned escapism...isn't that what it's all about?Well done JJ
ID_100240;10;7;The Force Awakens promised a lot and delivered more for both a first time Star Wars viewer or a die hard fan of the series.This movie had all the ingredients of success right from the get go. A captivating opening crawl, fresh characters who were well written and well acted, humor for all ages, relatable heroes and villains, nostalgia moments, and an awesome soundtrack by the incomparable John Williams. It was the first time in over 30 years where we had character development in a Star Wars movie that actually made you care about the heroes you were watching.JJ Abrams had a very tough job in his attempt to basically reboot the series and wipe the terrible impression left by the Prequels on even the most loyal fans. Not only did he succeed, but he actually managed to surpass expectations while providing a perfect balance between old and new, taking big risks with the movie's villain and integrating the new cast with the established heroes. You will care about the characters, you will care about the story, and the ending will leave you craving more while answering some of the most burning questions fans were asking, and at the same time, creating new mysteries and questions to explore in the future.We missed THIS Star Wars, it's great to be back! Thanks JJ, you did it justice!
ID_100241;6;3;"The whole film was just dull and adopted too many elements of modern Hollywood. Far too many key events and plot complications were disappointingly familiar. Important characters have little motivation to carry out key plot progress and I kept asking myself ""why does this person even care?""Storm troopers were more incompetent than ever and felt even more disposable than zombies. The off-screen characters were disposable on the same scale as what's typical of a superhero or apocalypse film. As is typical of those genres, viewers of The Force Awakens are led to believe that for some reason, the protagonists are the only ones who can save the day, even though there could in fact be other groups that could get involved if they so desired.There was more humour than in previous films, but much of it was low-brow and equivalent to slapstick, with the punchline being based on various people being stupid. Curiously, I found myself sometimes laughing a sentence before the rest of the theatre patrons, all Americans.I found the new black male protagonist to be about as likable as the brat from Spirited Away. I didn't especially like the new white female protagonist either."
ID_100242;8;9;"JJ Abrams is smart about how he plays with the toys he was given. If I had one criticism about this movie; it's to be too classic in its structure - no spoiler but the movie will feel very familiar. On the other hand, what is the right balance to strike between old & new? There is new in this movie - lots of it. The new characters are strong and different from their elders. The settings are cool, the Star Wars technology and designs amazing (there will be so many new toys from this movie!)But Abrams manages to weave the old in ways that please and bring a smile to the hardcore fans. That was very well done. And the end scene is amazing and poignant. I need to probably re-watch it but day 1, first screening I left happy to have spent two new hours in the much beloved Star Wars Universe - I guess this is what matters."
ID_100243;10;10;Episode 7 has redeemed a franchise that for many hardcore traditional fans had become a niggling source of disappointment.This is everything that 1, 2 & 3 weren't. The acting is solid - something we've never really associated with the franchise. The music is not clichéd - there are some new themes which will most likely catch on. The storyline is coherent and promises longevity and the action is gripping. From the opening scene you realize that 32 years after Return of the Jedi and the utter disappointment of 1, 2 & 3, Star Wars fans are finally in for a treat. It is a return to what worked,The directing is solid as is the dialogue, in fact probably the best dialogue in all seven films.
ID_100244;7;8;First of all, I will say this movie is great fun. Abrams does a great job with the action scenes and the pace is great. Rey is perhaps the greatest character in the series so far, I thought she was even better than Han Solo. Also I think Kylo Ren is a great character.So yes, the movie is a great experience and absolutely worth seeing, but there are a lot of problems, the major one being how familiar it is. From the first scene of the film, beats and plot points feel extremely familiar to the OT. The movie tries so hard to be the originals that it never really establishes anything new. People accusing it of being a remake are not as far off as I would like to say. I was also disappointed with the character of Finn, Boyega does a great job, but his character is a bit all over the place and extremely underdeveloped. Felt almost more like comic relief than anything which is a shame as he is almost a lead character. That's all I will say, there are more flaws, but they generally involve plot points and spoilers. Still, it is great fun, go see it in Imax.
ID_100245;3;1;"Good heaven's i don't know where to start. I've been watching star wars since i was four years old. I was a fan of it and then i grew out of it but the fonder memories never left me. I always loved the previous six films and kept recommending it to my non movie watching wife and my little daughter. They were so amazing, ""Empire strikes back"" name just makes me run back to my TV to see whats it all about.But this is a catastrophe. Whoever is responsible for doing this movie had done the greatest crime in movie history by destroying one of the best loved films of all time. What in the world he / she / they were thinking? why did star wars had to go down this way?A complete utter disaster (IMO), and i felt that acting of the new comers were pretty stupid, and childish. I am no professional but i remember the star wars episode 1 when Natalie portman played her role, that was brilliant (IMO). but this is just a plain disaster. I don't know if something is wrong with me or something is really wrong with the movie but from top to bottom i'd give it ZERO if it weren't for seeing old crew like SOLO and Millennium Falcon.I know some might say they are passing the torch... well you can pass torches in a much better way than this. If Disney or JJ abraham who ever that is responsible for this.... this is utter crap. Stop ruining LEGENDARY MOVIES... DO YOUR OWN THINGS"
ID_100247;8;9;"As a huge Star Wars fan from a young age, writing an objective review of this movie is almost impossible. It's evident from the reviews here on IMDb that people are either adoring this movie, or they're vastly disappointed by it. Like most other fans, I was thrilled to hear this movie announced and even more thrilled that George Lucas would no longer be involved. I do not appreciate the prequel movies and had high hopes for this movie, considering the new team behind it.Considering the disappointed responses from some fans, I believe I fall in the category of people that can really appreciate this movie for what it is, which is a good old fashioned Star Wars movie. It's got some flaws, but, in my opinion, there is far more to love than there is to hate.You've got to commend JJ Abrams and his team for the work they've put in. It's almost like they were consciously trying to mend some of the ""hurt"" the prequels caused in this aspect: the sets, the puppets, the effects are all overwhelmingly present, in a good way. That hated plastic, artificial feel from the prequels is gone.The fun doesn't stop there. The actors did a solid job, too. Whether it's the newcomers (whom you fear might not be up to the task) or the oldies (whom you fear might just be doing it for the heck of it) I wasn't once distracted by their acting, which means they're doing a fine job of it.I enjoyed the new characters and I feel the existing characters were done justice by their parts.Without revealing anything about the plot, suffice to say it's not the most original of plots. That being said, there is still enough to leave you wondering and a couple of surprises in there. In short, I don't really get the hate, even if the overall plot is probably the movie's weakest point.All in all, I feel this movie has redeemed Star Wars and put it back in its proper place. I will absolutely be seeing it again once it's been released on BluRay and I can't wait to show it to my kids in a few years.Go see it, I'm pretty sure you'll love it!"
ID_100248;8;10;Let me ask you this, after you watched Return of the Jedi...way back when...were you hoping that there would be another SEQUEL? A bunch of us did, but George Lucas gave us PREQUELS. Now don't get me wrong, the prequels have their flaws but do add to more depth to the Star Wars universe and got better towards the end. But The Force Awakens continues the legendary tale forward. We all wondered what might have happened after the empire was defeated...well now we know--sort of--I'm sure more will be revealed in the next sequel. But right now this movie is IT! This is the Star Wars sequel we've been waiting for! Less fancy CGI than the prequels, more action and even some comedy, and a good balance of nostalgia combined with the additon of new characters and moving the story forward. This movie respects the fans of the old Star Wars while forging ahead to create more new fans. It's awesome, best movie this Christmas season...so don't just sit there reading reviews...GO AND SEE IT!
ID_100249;8;10;The legendary epic saga continues as Star Wars returns with a new entry properly called The Force Awakens. Picking up three decades after Return of the Jedi even after the defeat of the Galactic empire a new threat is on the horizon as the darkness still is present in many forms. A young Sith lord has come to control much of the galaxy as that's the evil and mysterious Kylo Ren(Adam Driver in a strong performance)and the film would reveal a troubled family secret that's attached to Ren. And from the planet of Jakku a young lady named Rey(newcomer Daisy Ridley) a slave type scavenger who comes upon the scene to help the rebels once she exits her planet as this lady is a Jedi in the making. Finn(John Boyega is a storm trooper who takes a turn for the good to help fight evil in the galaxy. And in a real treat the return of old characters is abound with Han Solo and Princess Leia and the fury fuzzball who I say is Bigfoot's brother and that's Chewbacca all make a return! Overall it's a joy and thrill ride of space battles with ships and explosions and battles of good facing evil and the saga has mixed connections of characters new and old from the saga to strongly awaken the force and fly high thru the galaxy!
ID_100250;6;6;"Mixed feelings on this one. Again the hype machine set my expectations way too high. The trailers were brilliant. When I see trailers that good, my mind starts to imagine what to expect from the plot, I just cant help it. When the picture in my head matches what I see on the screen, I view that as predictable and relatively enjoyable (if made well), when on the other hand a movie exceeds my imagination, I hail that movie as something amazing. This ones a mixed bag, but fundamentally the story elements and characters are not very well written, rushed in some areas and overwritten in others, the balance is wrong if you pardon the pun. I just didn't care for the wonderfully directed action scenes and didn't emotionally connect with the main protagonists. The Star Wars universe is wonderfully created here and seeing Han,Leia etc on the big screen is a great tick in the box but therein lies the problem, it serves to be a tick in the box; the whole thing just feels a bit forced. George Lucus got a bashing for the prequels, but thats because he's not a great Director of actors, but he a great story writer - the prequels though badly executed, were actually good stories. Fortunately the force awakens doesn't suffer some of the cringe worthy moments present in the prequels but the story is one that you've seen before. Being cynical then this is just another franchise and as such is just a precursor or advertisement if you like for all the memorabilia that will be available for the kids to enjoy. Go see it but be sure to dumb down your expectations."
ID_100251;10;10;I entered the cinema complex with absolute no knowledge about the movie, the only thing I saw was one trailer, that's it. Even if you did watch all of the trailers, shots,... you can't know what will happen to you in the following 2hours and 15 minutes...First of all, the actors are really good, there's a fantastic dynamic between old and new characters. Second, there's a fantastic mix of different things happening. You have, obviously, the action. But besides that the movie also tries (and succeeds) to give you a deeper look in the emotions of the characters. Third, plot twists, plot twists plot twists.I think it is safe to say that this movie will go down as one of the best in the franchise. The director really does live up to the expectations!!
ID_100252;2;3;It's basically just a rehash of seven scenes and story lines from the first three films ... Put together with good cgi but apparently no decent writers ... Cliché upon cliché flashes across the screen colourfully ... A load of really dull characters do the sort of things you'd expect ... The villain is a bit of a wimpy dullard ... The original cast show up for a laugh ... But really there is certainly nothing new or interesting in this ... And quite frankly, in the age of Guardians of the Galaxy, this is outmoded in every way from the outset ... Mediocre film making that feeds on geek love of the first three films ... Unfortunately these are different times and this has none of the charm or excitement of the unique original trilogy

Negatives:"
ID_100256;10;10;"Rey, a scavenger barely eking out a living, needs to go home. She will do what she can to support the resistance, but she needs to come back to her planet. Nothing remains there for her but a hope that something or someone will find her.Fate decides otherwise. A force, maybe even ""the force,"" compels her otherwise to abandon home. Her awakening, though not completed by film's end, is what makes this film a triumph. And the cliff-hanger ending leaves you puzzled, yet satisfied that there are more revelations ahead. While you might think you have the answers, do not be surprised if you're surprised by next installment.Some have said that this episode is a reboot of ""A New Hope."" On the surface that might be a fair comment, but it seems to miss the point.Rey wanted to stay home-bound, hoping ""something"" or ""someone"" would find her. Away from home, she is now in a galaxy so very far, far away . . . .Now, so far away, has she found what she lost so long ago? Cue John Williams, buy your ticket and wait in your seats for Episode VIII."
ID_100257;10;10;"JJ made something that the previous trilogy completely missed; strong characters! Star Wars is back on track as we return to essentials: lovable, heartwarming and inspiring characters. Rey and Finn are the future of the saga! BB-8 had the same effect that R2D2 had in the original trilogy and fit in perfectly.All in all, Star Wars is back to its best! Pure 10/10"
ID_100258;9;10;A perfect blend of something fresh and familiar, the nostalgia feels are there but aren't the focus, the new characters are so exciting, stunning visual, emotionally effective space adventure, also does a lot of great world and character building that might be even more fun than before.P.s. In many places it feels like a reboot of episode IV.
ID_100259;7;9;"I saw Quentin Tarentino on Stephen Colbert the other night. He pointed out that no matter what movie he's gone to, he always remembers that it is still a movie...that he never falls into the spell to where he forgets. People say they do. He doesn't. I deliberately stayed away from any reviews or comments on this film. But I couldn't avoid all of the hype and that hype, by its very nature, made me constantly aware I was watching a movie that was going to make huge sums of money. I'm having trouble separating myself from that sense of ""why did they do this?"" And ""why did they choose her."" And, ""Isn't Harrison Ford a stitch."" Not Han Solo but Harrison Ford. Anyway, I have to admit that I sort of enjoyed it. It has lots of action, some interesting characters, a nostalgic feel, and so on. And a force is a force of course, of course. I skipped work so I could be at the first screening of the first ""Star Wars"" film back in 1977. I have to admit that as a reader of much challenging science fiction, I found the whole thing pretty bland. But it is a cultural entity, it bears watching. I don't know that there was much new here that would make one want badly to come back for more. When I saw the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy, I marked my calendar, hoping I would live to see all three episodes. And in that one, I already knew the plot. I'll be interested to see how this holds up to the test of time. For me the second set of the films are quite forgettable. And, again, for me, only one of the original caught my interest."
ID_100260;6;7;"This movie is a well made ""sequel"". I agree with many comments on this site: this is not a sequel, but a - to much commercially inspired - remake. The visual effects are perfect, the music is excellent, the actors are doing a perfect job. But still... the real Star Wars spirit is missing so much. The storyline is unidimensional and simplistic, the emotions are rather flat... Maybe the story was to complete after episode VI, and maybe it's just not possible to continue to milk this cow in a sensible way. I feel a bit betrayed in my expectations. For Episodes VIII, IX, X, .... till IC, I will wait for the BR-disk to be available instead of going to the movie theater."
ID_100261;2;7;Shoo. shoo. shoo. delete. remove. begone. eliminate. wipe clean
ID_100263;10;8;Isn't a little suspicious that a movie that has 95% approval by critics and 93% approval by fans at RottenTomatoes, an 81 score at Metacritic and a 8.1 overall score at IMDb has so much 1/10 stars reviews at the IMDb user reviews section? This section has been invaded by trolls. No doubt about it.I've watched this movie 3 times already and people always leave the theater with huge smiles on their faces. The Force Awakens is all about enjoying the ride — and what a ride! JJ Abrams achieved an impossible mission: he honored the past by setting the groundwork for the future without pissing off hardcore Star Wars fans.The pace of the movie and the witty dialogue makes the story fly. Much better than Return of the Jedi and especially the original, painfully outdated A New Hope. The Force Awakens is everything that fans and non-fans have been waiting for!
ID_100264;10;10;Really Great Movie ! First time watching star wars movies . It's far better than expectation
ID_100265;9;10;It is crucial that I don't spoil anything so I will stick to the general facts and the technical parts. The story you will have to find out on your own.I belong to a new generation that was introduced to SW when Episode I was coming out so I have a connection with the new trilogy as well as the old one. Still, the old one is way better and any and all debate about the quality of the movies ends here. The original trilogy is a masterpiece and revolutionized SF movies, the new one is visually stunning and fun. So, where does TFA fit in? I have to say that it has taken 32 years to make a real and powerful sequel. It has the magic of the original trilogy, but also visually stunning segments as the new trilogy.The story. The movie has a very slow and light way of revealing elements of the storyline. The script was well written and keeps one interested throughout the entire movie. Then, at one point it kicks you in the teeth with a stunning revelation that one just doesn't expect. That revelation is so strong and done so suddenly you just needs time for it to sink in, but just as that happens the story picks up the paste and leaves one with just one option - acceptance. Only a (jedi) master director could have done that in such a way. Also, this movie has one of the most unexpected and emotionally painful segments I have ever seen SW movies. All I can say is that it took some real courage to put it on the big screen. Furthermore, I feel obliged to defend this movie from all of the rambling that it is a remake/reboot. The movie has a very interesting way of playing with sequences seen in episode IV, and if you spotted them that only means you are a real SW fan. This movie is nowhere near a remake or a reboot nor does it want to be. It is a continuation of the original trilogy, and nothing more.The acting. Ridley and Boyega were phenomenal! She is extremely talented and all the scenes she was in just blew me away. Her possibility to switch from amazement to sorrow and loneliness were astonishing. Boyega on the other side was entertaining and a good comic relief. Still I had a feeling she had a harder character to portray so my compliments go to her. But, the best of them was Isaac who, I felt, had the time of his life playing Poe. But, I feel a bit more screen time could have been given to him because he could have given more. So lets wait for Episode VIII, maybe he gets more time there. As for Driver, his acting is so phenomenal that I am looking forward to his death scene more than anything else at this point. He understood exactly who he had to play and how. A great presentation. As for the old cast, well, it is very nice to see the original cast back in the movie that made them famous. Hamill's final appearance is an equivalent to the one done by Alec Guinness in a New Hope. Pure good and light just dripping from every segment of him. Fisher, despite her age, still pulls of Leia in a manner more serious and wiser that in the original trilogy. But, all of the compliments and standing ovations go to Harrison Ford, who gave the best performance of Han Solo ever. He is funny, he is filled with sorrow, he is kind, good, he is the ultimate childhood hero anyone could imagine.The CGI. It is crucial to say that there is very little CGI in this movie. Most of it looks real and the whole movie feels like it was done 30 years ago. The most important thing is that when CGI was used, it was used in small dosages and it was used wisely. There are spectacular fighting scenes, magnificent visual effects, done with very little CGI. The movie feels real and that is one of it's greatest advantages.The music. John Williams did a nice job here but, in my opinion, held back a bit for reasons unknown to me. Not a lot of the original music is present and when it is, it ends quite fast. Besides that, no new tunes can be heard.So, why 9/10? Well, the movie drags a bit at the middle and the music could have been more innovative or more tunes from previous movies should have been used.All in all, ladies and gentlemen, if you don't like this movie, then there is nothing else SW can do for you. It is the best possible sequel you could have hoped for, it is fun, it is dramatic, it has a great message. The original trilogy will never be made again and stop comparing them. View this movie as a sequel that really delivers to all the SW fans out there and all of the new ones that are yet to come. A new generation of SW fans are coming and they deserve a new generation of SW movies. Ones that will thrill and be corespondent with the time they are viewed in but still as powerful and great as the old ones. This movie is exactly that.May the force be with you.
ID_100266;9;10;Finally, the most anticipated movie of the 2015 is here! After gathering all the hype and hoopla around it over a year, Star Wars: The Force Awakens doesn't throw in any unpleasant surprises. Taking over from George Lucas, JJ Abrams makes sure he does not disappoint any Star Wars fans or cinema lovers in general. It is quite hard to make a sequel to the movie which had ended almost 30 years ago and especially when it comes to this era where most of the sequels are made just to mint money without a proper story, but Star Wars: The Force Awakens has quite a strong plot to build on. In fact with this movie, it looks like there are more to come.The story is once again about the conflict between 'The First Order' (like the Empire) and 'The Resistance' with the aim of finding lost Luke Skywalker. So for the fans asking where was Luke Skywalker in the trailer, the answer is 'that's what they are trying to find in the movie as well':-). The introduction of new characters Rey (Daisy Ridley), Finn (John Boyega) and Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) fit in the mix perfectly while the classic characters Han Solo, Leia, Chewbacca and C-3P0 still reminds us of what we watched Star Wars for. Since there is a huge time gap between the last Star Wars movie and this, there are changes with respect to the time when it comes to visual effects and slapstick humour (read Boyega). However the some of the original elements of the Star Wars are still kept intact like, the weird creatures, retro editing, lightsabers, music and of course taking hostages :). The movie is largely entertaining and yet true to the franchise.It is a tough job to star in a movie franchise which is older than you. But Daisy Ridley and John Boyega, not so well known British actors show what they are capable of. John Boyega's timing is excellent. Harrison Ford could sleepwalk the role of Han Solo and we all know that. Oscar Isaac does not have a lot of screenspace but it may change in the upcoming movies. Adam Driver as Kylo Ren is okay and Domhall Gleeson tries too hard to fit into the General Hux's character. However as always, Chewbacca and C-3P0 seem evergreen. Star Wars: The Force Awakens lives up to most of the expectations surrounding it. But remember, it is yet another beginning...
ID_100267;7;9;"Don't get me wrong. It's a fun movie. Great special effects, good action and likeable characters but it's also devoid of any originality to the point that it could be called a reboot. Also world building sucks and that Star Killer base was such a Deus ex machina. It was both taken straight from New Hope but also was a easy way for writers to erase all that happened between Return of The Jedi and Force Awakens.
To sum it up I don't regret watching it but I have no desire to see it again."
ID_100268;5;7;"I made an IMDb account just to say this: Even if you like 3D movies, do not see _The Force Awakens_ in 3D. This movie was not shot with 3D cameras. Not even the special effects shots were rendered in actual stereoscopic 3D. The whole thing is converted, and it's terrible. Characters often have the appearance of living cardboard cutouts. Sense of scale is horribly, horribly messed up. For example, we see a huge ship and part of it is made to look closer even though it is so far away that you shouldn't be able to see that effect (like how in real life, when you look at clouds near the horizon, they don't appear to have depth). Similarly with planets and other stuff. Instead of just looking natural, like movies shot or computer-rendered in 3D, the 3D is a distracting layer on top of what the cinematographer intended, drawing attention to whatever the people who did the conversion decided to push out or pull in from the screen. Combined with the usual drawbacks of the 3D technology (glasses darken the image and seem to ""box in"" the screen, etc.), it really got on my nerves, affecting my experience much more than I expected.Because of this distraction, I don't want to go in-depth on my opinion of the actual movie since it might very well have been different had I seen it in the original format. My feelings are ambivalent. On one hand it's mostly a rehash of the original trilogy with weaker characters and drama; on the other I can't deny that I (as someone who likes but is not super enthusiastic about _Star Wars_) had fun and was entertained. But I was hoping for something new and imaginative that would add to _Star Wars_, not just continue it.One of the reasons I saw it in 3D even though I would have preferred non-3D is that there are no IMAX showings (at least anywhere near me) that are not IMAX 3D. That's right, post-converted 3D is being forced on IMAX viewers, I presume so they can bump up the ticket price and because 3D attendance has been on the decline. Some parts of the film were shot in IMAX, and this means you can't see those parts in unadulterated IMAX.I feel bad that I already rewarded Disney and the theaters for this crap (not the film itself, just the way they're showing it) by shelling out extra for IMAX 3D. Please, don't reward them any more. If you see _The Force Awakens_, see it without 3D. You can save money (it's not like this movie needs more support) *and* have a better viewing experience.Edit: I found out that the IMAX 3D for this movie basically isn't even IMAX, in the vast majority of theaters (in the US at least). Can't link to articles; just google ""'the force awakens' 'IMAX 3D'"" and they should come up."
ID_100271;8;10;It's an awesome time to be alive when your life co-exists at a time when 'Star Wars' ruled the cinema screens. This is the film I was looking for. Being reunited with some old friends brought a nostalgic smile to my face as I returned to a time long ago, in a galaxy far, far away. It was simply coming home for this 'Star Wars' fanatic. Before I even thought about reviewing this latest installment, 'The Force Awakens', I had to see a viewing not once but twice. The first was out of pure excitement and after allowing my brain to process what I had just seen, I took a quick trip to the local cinema and relive the magic all over again.J.J. Abrams has to be commended for taking on this massive task. The self confessed fan knows exactly what 'Star Wars' means to the countless souls throughout the world but in saying this, the man is a professional and does get paid the big bucks. What Abrams has done well is instantly transporting the audience back to galactic worlds where the forces of good and evil are played out in an eternal struggle for supremacy. Against the backdrop of wonderful galactic arenas and timeless characters it doesn't take long for the audience to know that they are watching something uniquely 'Star Wars'. J.J has introduced new characters to drive the fresh direction of the space saga but is still respectful of the past by casting familiar faces that have made the 'Star Wars' epic so special. Abrams experience with the rebooted 'Star Trek' series has given him the knowledge and wisdom to recreate an epic universe and recognise the importance of George Lucas's story.'The Force Awakens' begins thirty years after the events of 'Return of the Jedi'. A map containing the whereabouts of the legendary Jedi Knight, Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), is placed into a BB8 droid by a resistance fighter named Poe Dameron (Oscar Issacs) before he is captured by the New Order led by the evil Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) who possesses the power of the force. And so the episode begins and it isn't long before we are introduced to Finn (John Boyega) and Rey (Daisy Ridley) who cross paths with each other on the junkyard planet of Jakku. They are forced to escape the planet with the BB8 droid after being tracked by the enemy and it is here that they fortuitously run into Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew). Together, they all set about returning the droid back to the Resistance before the New Order can intercept them. The Millennium Falcon races across the galaxy where General Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher) awaits the precious cargo. Absolutely brilliant stuff!The new cast of Ridley, Boyega, Issacs and Driver drive this new trilogy for a new generation. Each have created their own piece of history in the 'Star Wars' saga and need to continue to grow in the roles that they have created just as the original cast did before them. Daisy Ridley looks very comfortable in her starring role and doesn't seem overwhelmed by the magnitude of the narrative. Ridley works well with John Boyega with each increasingly familiar in the others presence. Harrison Ford is prominent throughout the film as his timeless character, Han Solo, effortlessly engaging with the younger cast members. Han's relationship with his lifelong mate, Chewbacca, oozes charm and is worth the price of admission alone. They truly are two of the greatest characters ever to grace the cinematic screen.J.J. Abrams has delivered an engrossing space fantasy that will satisfy the fans who have waited for the magic to one day return. He has been respectful to George Lucas's story but has had enough vision to open up avenues that the rest of the trilogy must explore. With the baton being past to a new Director for the next installment, the final trilogy has the potential for greatness. It is calling to us all.
ID_100272;1;1;The story looks like they wrote it in a day they took the same idea as before and to get the fans back they though in the old cast. Each shot was cut down to the minimum typical Attention defect disorder public can keep their attention. It jumps from one scene to another with minimal dialogue just enough to follow the story. The acting is horrible in some scenes. I hate JJ Abrams movies his style is nothing more then computer aided action blasted at you every few seconds. He cuts the scene down so bad the actors say a few words then cut say a few words cut. George Lucas should have left it alone and never sold it as much as I didn't like his last 2 Star Wars he made this is 100 times worse then anything George Lucas ever made. I'm so glad I never went to the movies to see this I suspected it was bad.
ID_100273;10;9;First of all, I don't know why there are people really bashing this movie. It is actually very good. I am already a fan since 1977, when the first...or better said, the fourth episode was released. And now, 32 years after episode VI, there is finally the continuation...sort of. No more Empire. Now there is the New Order. The interesting thing is that the 32 years that passed since episode VI, is also the time that passed in the story. Leia and Han have a son who appears in the story. I won't tell who or what he is... You should see this for yourself. Unlike episode I where an idiot figure like Jar Jar Binks appeared, speaking a ridiculous English, there is a nice new robot, named BB- 8. In short, I loved the movie, the action, the effects, and let's not forget the awesome 3D. Definitely worth watching...more than once. :)
ID_100274;10;10;"Only people that ""think"" they are fans are giving this movie negative reviews. This movie is absolutely incredible and I don't think anyone could have done any better with it. If your nit picking little things you should really re-think your entire view. This was probably one of the hardest movies ever to remake and JJ Abrams did an awesome job. He had a lot to live up to, and a lot to follow up.....and he did it!!For those of you bashing any of the story lines.. if you had the slightest idea of what you were talking about you would know George Lucas already had Most of this story written, and J.J. followed most of it. So complaining about the story is silly. You should sit back and enjoy the movie and appreciate you were given the opportunity in time to view it. So stop picking things apart and enjoy this movie, I saw it last night and cannot wait to see it again in a few hours!"
ID_100275;8;9;I still stand by the idea that this movie is awesome. It's a great return to form after the mess that is the prequel trilogy. It's unfortunate that the following movies make a lot of this one dumb in retrospect.
ID_100276;10;10;"I'll start by saying I have been a Star Wars fan for as long as I can remember. I remember back to when I was 3 and watching the movies non stop, playing with my Star Wars Lego, action figures, lightsabers and costumes made by my mum and always loving every second of it. I'm a fan of many franchises from Marvel to DC to Doctor Who but the biggest fandom of all has always been Star Wars. I may not have been around when the original movies were released but I am honestly one of the biggest Star Wars fans in the world.When I read online that Disney had bought Lucas Film and announced a third trilogy, I was mad excited, constantly wondering what it would be about and laughing at the fact George Lucas said in an old behind the scenes feature, without any hesitation, that there would never be an Episode 7. Ever since September 2012, I have been eagerly awaiting this new installment. incredibly excited at the release of every new trailer and then the moment finally came where I would watch the movie for the first time. I didn't know the plot, I avoided all the spoilers I could and when I saw it, my mind was blown up like a Deathstar. The movie was everything I'd hoped for. Thankfully, nothing was spoiled for me. JJ Abrams who directed the Star Trek films which are some of my top favourites along with the writer of The Empire Strikes Back and Raiders of the Lost Ark, made a film I loved every second of. It felt great to have Star Wars back again. I had the most fun I've ever had watching a movie before and I'm not just saying that. I've given it a few days to sink in, I've seen it three times and my thoughts are still the same. Although I'm sorry to see on IMDb so many of the common reviews are the negative ones. People are saying this movie is a reboot of A New Hope (even though the original cast is obviously in it) but they also say this because the story is similar. I understand their points but they've blown it way out of proportion. For example, yes there is Star Killer base which is basically another Death Star, yes Kylo Ren is a strong, evil and memorable villain like Darth Vader, yes Rey is from a desert planet like Luke and put there for reasons unknown at the time but I didn't see the First Order take over a Resistance ship and kidnap Poe before he gave information to BB8 who went in an escape pod and was bought by Rey's Uncle Owen to later meet an old jedi who took Rey and BB8 with him on board a smuggler's ship to deliver BB8 to a planet destroyed by Star Killer base to wind up on the base, saving Poe, escaping, losing the Old Jedi to Kylo Ren so Rey can come back on an x-wing to blow up Star Killer base. I didn't see any of that. It's less similar to A New Hope than people say. A New Hope was the seed of the franchise so all films are a root grown from the seed, they all have their similarities. In fact, Star Wars has always been about an unlikely hero destined to become something greater to help the forces of good to stop an evil army. This movie is a new generation of that which is exactly what the fans said they want. So don't be fooled by people who say it's another A New Hope. But then again, you can't argue with the fanboys because one minute the prequels are too different and now The Force Awakens is too similar. Of course you just can't please everyone but don't be fooled into thinking this movie is everything the haters say it is. I'm a die hard fan and I love Star Wars: The Force Awakens. I love the acting from everyone especially the phenomenal Daisy Ridley, I loved all the characters, especially Kylo Ren, the very evil villain you love to hate, who I had bought posters, costumes and toys of months prior to seeing the movie, I loved the story, the humour and the directing. I loved the combination of practical and CGI effects. BB8 is not only believable because he's a practical prop, but he is an adorable character and always fun to watch. It felt like Star Wars and I loved it. I could have only wished to see a little more of Captain Phasma, R2, C3PO, Leia and the new Starkiller base but other than that, I loved this movie and I cannot wait to buy it on BluRay and I cannot wait for Episode VIII coming out in 2017. I am not sugar coating, I loved this movie. I give, without any hesitation, Star Wars: The Force Awakens a 10/10. I do believe this is my favourite Star Wars film of all time so far. As I said in my YouTube video blog, ""If you're a Star Wars fan, you'll love this movie and if you see this movie and you hate it, you are not a Star Wars fan."" Haha!"
ID_100277;7;6;The time has finally come, a new star wars film has arrived. A sequel to the original trilogy and hopefully an apology for the 3 prequels. Also now in the hands of Disney who have had the rights to star wars at the parks for years. Seemed like a good move and honestly I think it was a wise choice. I shuddered when I heard JJ Abrams was the chosen director. I find him over- rated and personally dummbed down star trek and ruined it completely for a new generation. However I was still excited and would give him the benefit of the doubt. So how does the new movie fair?.......well it basically has the exact same plot as A New Hope with old and new characters thrown into the mix. All in all the movie was not terrible but it felt like they wanted to play it too safe and rely on nostalgia to convince movie goers that star wars is back. Watching it I couldn't help but fall back in love because of this nostalgia however that being said upon analization of the film afterwards proved to remove the beer goggles.As stated before this is a re-has of a new hope. There is another death star, a new disappointing villain, however he may grow into a badass but for now is weak and pathetic. The pacing was also terrible and everything happened to fast and relies on previous knowledge. For fans coming into this film without seeing previous movies may ask themselves, this is what the hype was all about?That being said it was hard to hate on this film, because they did try but were not wanting to take a gamble and branch out into a complete new storyline with risks. I'm curious to see what direction this goes however I'm scared as the next director hired is the gentleman who bastardised jurrasic world. In my personal oppion I'd give this a 7 however rating this as a film not as a fan it would get a soft 6.
ID_100278;10;10;"Being a fan of the original Star Wars films, and then having the franchise all but ruin it with I, II, and III, I had high expectations with this film. But with J.J. Abrams and Disney, they came in swinging, and hit a home run. The story line goes back to the basics of what made the original excellent! It had an ""old Star Wars"" feel from the beginning, and that was just perfect! We saw old friends, and met new ones. There were twists, moments revealed, moments of shock, moments of cheering. The writing was excellent and I thought they played the story out well enough to give you enough of a taste to fill your empty Star Wars stomach. At the end of the movie I wanted to jump up for joy - but as it was the entire audience cheered, and whooped, and fell in love with Star Wars all over again. Well done JJ Abrams and Disney....well done! I'll be seeing it again VERY soon."
ID_100279;7;7;JJ did a great job. Especial effects look great. This movie takes you back to the style of the first 3 movies. Less digital, more realistic. I liked that a lot.The problem is the story.When you watch the movie you already seen all of that in the first movie of George Lucas (ep IV). They remix the characters, the landscape change, but what happens in the story is basically all very alike the first movie.There is no new ideas on how to continue the story, so they scrambled and gave it again.Another problem is the lack of dept of the characters. Princess Leia wasn't amazing in the first movies, but really has nothing special to bring in this movie. The new pretty face of the movie does an awesome job, but the story doesn't help her, and makes her do some not believable things for those how know the SW universe.Is still a good movie to watch, but again, not something that gets the SW fans satisfied.If only the story was as good as the special effects...PS. The new dark lord. Bad, really bad. PS2. A good thing: You would never say this is a Disney movie!
ID_100280;6;3;Possibly the most incompetent script ever written for a major motion picture sequel. It's completely wrong to call it a rip-off of Star Wars - it only steals the message-in-a-droid idea and then just goes into a morass of pointless coincidence and plotless sequences until they decide to blow up the Death Planet at which point the story much more closely resembles Return of the Jedi - right down to the father/son confrontation intercut with the fighter attack. The new characters are however quite lovable and they honestly deserved a better story. There are way too many unexplained introductions of icons from the original trilogy (Why is the Falcon there? How did she get Luke's lightsaber?) and it just seems like the filmmakers couldn't be bothered figuring out how to make it all make sense and just gave up.
ID_100281;9;10;This franchise does not need to be defended by anyone. It exists as a juggernaut of franchises and cannot and will not be stopped. The Force Awakens is a spectacular entry in the Star Wars franchise. I take issue with anyone who finds nothing in this entry to enjoy. It literally is a joy to watch from beginning to end. It brings back just about every feeling you could want in a sequel of this nature. The original cast members that return are quite simply Star Wars royalty and all do their jobs excellently. Ford steals the movie as Solo in a performance that will be legendary. The new cast's in Ridley, Boyega, Gleeson, Driver and Isaac are all home runs and they did a great job of laying the ground work for future episodes. The force is strong again... and Star Wars is back in every way possible. Great job by all involved.
ID_100282;9;9;I know it's popular online to trash the Disney trilogy, and I agree with some of the hate that Last Jedi and Rise of Skywalker gets, but this movie doesn't deserve any of the hate it gets, in my opinion. This movie was fantastic, if you ask me. It had some very good and likable characters, a nice story, and a very good villain in Kylo Ren. And I think this is movie fed off the original trilogy in the best and most enjoyable way possible.8.7/10.
ID_100283;10;10;"Star Wars: The Force Awakens is a fabulous film and is a good dose of escapism from mundane everyday life, just like The Original Trilogy was. We can forget all our problems when seeing this movie. The Force Awakens sparks a joy for the child in all of us which many of us have been waiting for since The Empire strikes Back or Return of the Jedi. There couldn't have been a story more worthy of the subtitle 'Episode VII'.I will say that though the film is derivative of the other Star Wars films at times, it uses the tropes to the benefit of the story rather than detract from it, like the whole Trade Negotiations rubbish that plagued the Star Wars Prequel Trilogy. J.J. Abrams reinvigorates the assaulted franchise and gives us some of the most powerful moments ever seen in the saga.Don't give in to the trolling of the 'prequel fanboys'. They're just upset that somebody did a much stronger job than Lucas could have managed on his own. They couldn't tell a good movie apart from Transformers 3 & 4, or any Michael Bay movie for that matter. We are entitled to our own opinion and mustn't succumb to these 'emotion vampires' that do their best and ultimately fail to make a difference in the end.The Force Awakens is a refreshingly fun film that as a form of escape in this day and age plagued by terrorism, cyber-terrorism, LGBT discrimination and racism. Star Wars is a welcoming series that isn't conformed by anything in our world ; it's a self-realising ecstasy that will always be there for us like an old friend.Edit: While I do still love this film I do not dismiss the fact that some people did not like the film very much. What I do dismiss is their dismissal of anyone liking it or disliking it unsubjectively. We're our own persons and not 'sheeple'. The Force Awakens is just a film, and let's agree to disagree and not spit venom at each other for it, okay? I know that it's not totally original but it didn't need to be. I loved this movie for what it IS, not for what it isn't. There; I've said what I needed to be addressed."
ID_100284;8;8;Star Wars: The Force Awakens was a copy of A New Hope , using a similar plot and plot points of the original Star Wars film. This is hardly a new revelation: critics and fans made that point when it was first released. The plan was to make an entertaining if safe film to win back fans who displeased with the Prequel. The Force Awakens manages this with ease: it was a fun, popcorn film with excellent special effects and action sequences. When compared to J. J. Abrams' Star Wars work Rise of Skywalker, The Force Awakens actually had some build-up and invested in the characters.
ID_100294;6;7;"There's no time travelling in Star Wars, is there? No, didn't think so. Watching ""Episode 7: The Force Awakens"", however, the much anticipated 2015 continuation of the original trilogy, you would think you'd been thrown back to 1977 and were watching, in some alternate dimension, a re-run of the very first film itself. Sceptics have been writing for years on the 'place' Hollywood blockbusters have in the canon of film as an art-form, deriding them for being derivative, or for too often coming to form replications of each other, but this really does take the space-cake. The film is, in fact, so reminiscent in certain places of Episode IV that you might just as well call it An 'Old' Hope.The film begins with a mother-ship's silhouette blotting out a sun and the launch of a series of spaceships which head down to a nearby planet. The bigger ship, belonging to The First Order, which has risen out of the ashes of Darth Vader's old Evil Empire, in doing so infers a powerful ability to blot out or ruin anything it comes into contact with. Inside one of the smaller ships, the populous is cleverly introduced via some flickered lighting, which actually alludes to a later crisis of conscience one of the inhabitants will have. Once on the surface, they ambush a village with connections to the Resistance in looking for a piece of a map which will, apparently, direct them to the legendary Luke Skywalker, who, being the last Jedi, will win the war for the Dark once and for all if they find and kill him. At the last moment, a pilot called Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) hides the portion inside a small robot who escapes with it.Enter the protagonist, Rey (Daisy Ridley); a young-ish orphan, who should probably look grubbier and uglier, living on the same planet and who trades in scrap from crashed spaceships of the first war for portions of food. Her literal harvesting of these parts from old cruisers of the first three films is, in some ways, a reflection of how the film itself is taking from past efforts. Into her world ambles said droid and the map, and then later still the character of Finn (John Boyega), who is a storm trooper for the Dark but decides to change sides. Finn's introduction to the film, like Rey's, is a slow unsheathing of a mask or helmet to reveal the face in close-up, inferring a kind of duality or connection - sure enough, they spend the majority of the film together and become close allies.Dodging the incoming First Order, the two make off with one of the more famous pieces of Star Wars paraphernalia which they find lying around in the area, Rey demonstrating piloting skills you would have thought were beyond her without the ability to practise to any degree. After breaking down in outer space, they are caught up by two familiar faces in Chewbacca and Harrison Ford's Han Solo, who have become, in the years since the war, interstellar versions of long distance truckers. Their haul on this particular occasion are large man eating squid-like monsters. Do we think they'll escape and wreak havoc, or not? What do you think? The film then becomes somewhat of a race to rebel HQ, with the villains never too far from their tails. Later on, attention shifts to a weapon of mass destruction the First Order possess which, despite existing in the shadow of the old Empire, is ten times more powerful.The film is not a disaster by any means, but it leaves a lot to be desired. I think it probably attempts to cram too much in for it to feel like a work of real substance: the decision by a trooper to defect; a sub-plot to do with a father/son relationship; the foiling of an evil scheme; the rekindling of two old flames in Solo and a certain Princess. Its approach is too pulpy to take seriously; I felt its introduction of Rey and her lonely world, a stretch of film that is told visually without dialogue for a about two minutes, could have gone on for another ten, while its finale is similar to, but probably not as thrilling as, 1996's ""Independence Day"" with its final assault unfolding in conjunction with a dogfight.Then there is the issue of one particular cast member who had already said he didn't want to be a part of the franchise after this edition, so his character has been written out. This is sad for the fact we lose an old face, yes; but it also demeans the artistic pursuit of direction and damages the concept of auteurism. When decisions to take a project in particular direction are made by these means, and not by a creative vision, just what are we even left watching?Essentially, ""The Force Awakens"" is a re-treading of Lucas' initial 1977 effort: the message being hidden in a droid; the Vader-style villain in black turning up with his troopers looking for it; the young desert-dwelling hero bumping into it; the stumbling into an intergalactic adventure; the tracking shot through the Cantina-style bar, etc. What is new is not even necessarily new either: a post-Hunger Games style heroine and a post-Wall*E style droid hardly blow us away. For all the crowing on increased diversity, read Manthia Diawara's 1988 essay 'Black Spectatorship: Problems of Identification & Resistance' on black and white characters sharing the screen for problems linked to John Boyega's casting. Diawara's observations of things in ""48 Hours""; ""Beverly Hills Cop"" and ""Rocky II"" might just as well be applied here, particularly during the climactic lightsaber fight. What ""progress"" has even been made? In the end, JJ Abrams has created a decent actioner and provided us with the buzz of seeing some old faces, but nothing much else."
ID_100295;10;6;Great plot, great actors, everything is so amazing
ID_100297;8;10;I am coming from a place of honesty, and for some reason people just hate on other's opinions. Growing up with Star Wars since I was little, the franchise has held a special place in my heart. And as I grew up, I recognized there are flaws in both the original trilogy and the prequels.The sequels are by far no means perfect but that cannot take away from the love and dedication that a collaborative group of people made on screen in 2015. The Force Awakens might follow similar beats to the 1977 original but it is a film that truly captures the tone and hope that George Lucas created back 40 years prior.It seems cool now to hate Disney and what they did with this trilogy. Again, this is no perfect film and its sequels are not perfect either. But the rewatch-ability and the experience of seeing this film with multiple generations coming together in a theater will never be topped.The Force Awakens is not the best Star Wars movie but I think in a few years time... it will be looked on more fondly for the spark of excitement and wonder it created in the fandom upon first release.
ID_100298;9;10;"In 2005 I was in a massive, packed theater on opening day for ""Revenge of the Sith"", convinced it would be the final ""Star Wars"" movie. The mood was electric, the audience was buzzing with excitement and there were massive cheers and applause every time a new character appeared on screen. It was an incredible moment and one I was sure I'd never experience again.In 2015 I was in a massive, packed theater on opening day for ""The Force Awakens"". There was a smattering of applause at the beginning and end of the film and when the Falcon, Han Solo and Chewbacca first appear. There were also a few laughs for a couple of scenes. Other than that, silence. Walking out of the theater, surrounded by hundreds of moviegoers, no one uttered a word. Everyone just shuffled out in a deathly quiet.Now don't get me wrong, ""The Force Awakens"" is a fantastic movie and the best thing JJ Abrams has ever done. However it also underwhelmed me in a way Episodes I to III never did. There is enough good, even great in it, and I have enough good will towards the series to name it my favorite film of the year, but I also have major problems with it, which range from the outer packaging all the way to the creamy center.Everything you feared since hearing JJ Abrams was directing has come to pass (lens flares aside). His obsession with the first three films as well as ""real sets, practical effects"" is taken much too far. You can see everything coming from a mile away, none of the mysteries and twists work and there is zero emotional weight to the film. The endeavor also suffers from a major case of telling rather than showing and as such we are pleadingly being asked to love our new heroes rather than liking them of our own volition.Of the new characters, Snoke and Hux are great, Kylo Ren is the weakest villain the series has ever had, Captain Phasma is useless, Rey and Finn are fine, Poe Dameron makes no impression whatsoever and BB-8 is pretty cool but very redundant.Again it's a great film, and I'll see it again in theaters. Just be careful to keep your hype in check."
ID_100299;7;8;"not flawless, but still very, very good.what many negative reviews say is that its a ""remake"" rather than a sequel. it certainly seems that way, but it was definitely done that way for a reason: to appease star wars fanboys. you can see so much of a new hope in this movie that its crazy. but that isn't a bad thing. its just something that will cleanly divide viewers of this movie. some people love it, some people criticize it for being this way. personally, i think they went just a little overboard with the nostalgia, but they did what they originally planned to do: revitalize the series, try to remedy the damages done by the prequels, and start off what looks to be a great trilogy. this movie does a lot of setting up, with plot, characters, and even themes. rage is something i had never seen in a sith but it was always said throughout all of the star wars movies that it was a path to the dark side, and this movie really showed that. it also answered a lot of questions that people had coming into this movie.one thing i especially liked are the new characters. finn is very charismatic and rey is a strong independent woman, and they can be correlated with han and leia, but finn its as if they took some of hans qualities out of finn and plugged in some of Luke's original qualities in a new hope, and then did the same with some of the leia qualities in rey. overall, I'm really excited for these characters, and new ones to come (benicio del toro). also, I'm now a fan of Oscar isaac, and while his acting was questionable at times, he did a great job as a character who wasn't really based off of anybody.while we are on the topic of acting, i want to mention that abrams did a great job of taking these D-list actors and turning them into stars.the main reason i couldn't hate all of the correlations with a new hope is because, well, its star wars, and they copied great concepts from a great movie."
ID_100300;10;2;I saw it but my nieces and nephew were making so much noise that I couldn't concentrate
ID_100301;1;1;"This movie like most Hollywood movies last few years is devoid of soul, lacking in talent and full of social agendas and pandering to social activist. As a result has left behind the original fans. Little by little the masses are becoming aware of the shallowness of what they are being shown. When a movie is put together by executives whose main objective is money rather than passion for storytelling and the arts this is what you get. The original SWs had a story to tell it created an alternative universe with its own legends heroes and laws. This is why it was so fun to watch. This last episode has destroyed all that and extracted the last glimmer of soul out of it. This director (I forgot his name) did the same with Gene Roddenberry's Star Trek, as well. I don't blame him solely for that, he is after all a small wheel in the hungry corporation that is Hollywood. I am sure he needs permission to scratch his head. As to the feminism that the new movies are pandering to,; it has become so tiresome and predictable that I can not bring myself to watch any more movies out of Hollywood. It all seems to go through the same cookie cutter mold; females have to be unbeatable and need to badmouth men and tough. A little reality will make the female sex more fun to watch. I do dislike the leading role being female, not because of the sex but because of the reason she is there, to prove an unrealistic point. Keep digging Hollywood, I for one and many others I know have better things to do than waste our time with your shallow pastimes. And when we watch movies they are mostly from China, Japan, Europe anywhere but America. They have not been destroyed by shallowness of capitalism and feminism."
ID_100302;9;9;J.J Abrams's return to a galaxy far far away is a pleasant one with 'Star Wars: The Force Awakens'. Returning the beloved characters of the Skywalker saga and showing what happened to them.The visuals are beautiful as is John Williams score, the brilliant performances also help with Harrison Ford fully channeling Han Solo, and not a grizzled Harrison Ford. The newcomers are very good as well with John Boyega and Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver. The largest complaint I could even have with this film is the fact that despite the over 30 year wait for an Episode VII we get something very familiar, which is obviously intentional to bring back the feeling of Star Wars to fans, however the film becomes predictable once you see the formula, the film is still fun, and does have new ideas but overall you see the similarities. Despite being a very familiar film, it is heavily filled with fun nostalgia and a Star Wars movie that will leave you feeling like you're a kid again.
ID_100303;8;9;It is good and I give it 8/10. I am no fan of J.J. Abrams Star Trek movies but this worked. It has some weak moments and one bad actor that you can never guess beforehand but contrary to my doubts, Daisy Ridley is good and it's miles miles better than the Prequel Trilogy, even Revenge of the Sith.Everything looks real and the lightsaber fights are great. Not like those dancing glowing stick numbers in the prequels. The integration of the legacy actors is done real well and surprised me the most. It went so fast and felt so short. Not one dull moment in this. Even the Original Trilogy had dull moments. I feel this can benefit greatly from an extended cut.This is a great start and a better director can do wonders. This makes the prequels look even worse. Only now you will realize what could have been done.
ID_100304;8;10;"I thoroughly enjoyed Episode IV, loved Episode V, thought that Episode VI was enjoyable but too ""kiddy."" I consider episodes I, II, III worthy distractions at best. With the announcement of Episode VII a flicker of hope began to burn. Could JJ and Disney re-ignite what has been considered a world-wide cultural phenomena? Could new characters be introduced that engaged our hearts with emotion and excitement as Luke, Leia, Han, Chewy, Darth and the Droids did? I am writing this to tell you THE FIRE HAS BEEN RE-IGNITED! The Force Awakens has managed to re- kindle the fire of Star Wars. The new characters draw the viewer in and make you care about what happens to them (something Ep. 1-3 failed to do). The connection to the familiar old characters didn't feel forced and made it fun. I can't wait to see Episode VIII! I need to see it! I did not think I would feel that way about Star Wars again. V and V are still my favs, but VII has proved to be the awakening we've been looking for."
ID_100305;10;10;"I sat with anticipation, the likes of which I had not felt since the premiere of the Special Edition or Episode I when I was in Middle and High School. The marketing had worked its magic on me and transported me into the haze of nostalgia to prime me for, what I hoped would be, the second coming of Star Wars, delivering us from the wasteland of the prequels which we had been languishing within.Walking out of the theater, I couldn't have been happier. Sure there are little things here and there that I didn't care for but on the whole, everything I love about Star Wars was back.In my review of ""The Last Jedi"" I talk about how much I love that film because it ""brought the force back into Star Wars."" I lament the way that the force is relegated to the role of superpower in the prequels and comment that we get hints of the forces return to prominence in ""The Force Awakens."" Having revisited this film more recently, now, I realize that ""The Force Awakens"" had already done this and brought life back into the franchise.The spirit of Star Wars was lost in the prequel years. Films that had been about the choice between good and evil, the seduction of darkness, and the redemptive power of light became about Visual Effects Fireworks displays, convoluted political plots, and lightsaber fetish inspired dancing. The central questions of the first trilogy are questions of character and motivation not playing plot fill-in-the-blanks or fan service.""The Force Awakens"" returns us to form, where the light vs. dark questions and story of the force are once again central. The turning point of the lightsaber fight at the end of the film turns not on a loss of temper, a flourish of the sword, or a quick thinking characters ideas. It turns, instead, on the moment wherein Rey (Daisy Ridley, ""Murder on the Orient Express"") begins to believe that if she stands up for the light, the light will empower her to defeat Ren (Adam Driver, ""Marriage Story"").I will forgive much of a film for the sake that it has gotten this correct. Luckily, there isn't much for me to forgive because the film is so joyfully and beautifully made.The new characters are great and recapture the young spirit of the originals. We forget that the mains in ""A New Hope"" were kids when they made those movies (Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher, and Harrison Ford) and their youth is apparent in the way they speak to each other, the joking together they engage in, and the spirit of adventure they all share. Daisy Ridley, John Boyega (""Pacific Rim: Uprising""), and Oscar Isaac (""Ex Machina"") are that youth, excitement, zeal, and adventure in this film. Watching Rey and Finn go back and forth about holding hands and who knows more than the other is very reminiscent of Han and Leia. Poe teaching Finn to shoot in the TIE fighter feels like Luke and Han shooting down TIEs in the Millennium Falcon. Rey, longing for meaning and family feels a lot like Luke longing for adventure.For many, these similarities are a negative. They see ""Force Awakens"" as a copy of ""A New Hope."" A lesser copy. I don't see it that way at all. To me, this is a breath of fresh air.On the surface, I can understand how some people, without thinking all that deeply about the subject or perhaps simply parroting reviews they watched online, might see the films as being extremely similar.After all, the protagonists in both films begin on desert planets, a droid holds a secret piece of information in both, they visit a wretched hive of scum and villainy, a super-weapon blows up some planets, the super weapon is destroyed by a single fighter, and a mentor is sacrificed within site of the one they are mentoring. There are loads more correlations but I want to point out that they are all similar only on the surface. Almost in every case, the meanings behind these things are different.Rey may be on a desert planet, but unlike Luke, who wants desperately to get away, she wants to stay. Even once she leaves she wants to go back. Her motivation is exactly the opposite of Luke's and people have the audacity to say that it's basically the same. I could go down the line of the objections pointing out how all of them are simply surface similarity, and if someone wants me to do that, I suppose I could on the podcast, but I don't want to belabor my point here.Let's just say that after watching it over and over, ""The Force Awakens"" is simultaneously reminiscent of the original trilogy but presents similar themes and ideas in new ways. To me, that is a remarkable accomplishment for a filmmaker, especially when considering the size and importance of this film to the studio making it.I simply don't understand how people who loved the original trilogy can watch this film and not like it. It is EXACTLY what this sequel should have been.Except for the rathtars. That sequence blew."
ID_100306;7;9;"Although sometimes I wonder if we're so attached to the series that we can overlook a lot of things. I think people who grew up with the series would rate most as at minimum ""Watchable"". Having said that, did not really like I and II very much but Force Awakens was great. I totally Love BB8, he (she?) is the best. Good acting and good plot line. Good combination of drama/SPX/action."
ID_100307;6;6;Initially I wasn't going to write a review of Episode VII, but I've just seen a Duracell ad featuring light sabres and it was too much.The Force Awakens is not a bad movie, but it's a pandering to nostalgia, without any courage to explore new ground, motives or motifs. In the attempt to not alienate fans or heaven forbid hurt sales of toys or tie-in products, JJ Abrams rehashed all the key points from the original trilogy. If it were not for BB-8 or Kylo Ren's light sword and the hilt, it would have been devoid of anything original.From the production and directing point of view, there's nothing to reproach to this movie. It's easy to watch, not boring or annoying, but it's utterly unoriginal and a major disappointment in this area. The new characters are bland except maybe for Daisy Ridley's. Adam Driver is completely unconvincing as the villain, John Boyega's Finn could be deleted from the movie without anyone noticing, and as for Han Solo, Harrison Ford delivers, the only bright point in the movie.That's about it. Fans will like it or love it, people new to SW (I know those do exist) can pick up without needing to know the previous films, and it will generate billions in worldwide sales. Mission accomplished. Hopefully JJ will not repeat his inexcusable demolition of the Star Trek franchise. Then again, Star Trek is intelligent and thus can be dumbed down. Star Wars, not so much.
ID_100308;5;7;"It was inevitable that they were going to milk the franchise long after the story assumed to be done. ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" brings back the characters from episodes 4-6 and adds some new ones. Given the frequent one-liners and self-references, I get the feeling that the aim is to make all the nerds/geeks have fun. I will say that unlike ""The Phantom Menace"", I understood the plot this time; with the former, I didn't understand the plot until I listened to ""Weird Al"" Yankovic's song ""The Saga Begins"" (a parody of ""American Pie"").So, it's no masterpiece. The plot is mainly two hours of light saber fighting and shooting lasers. Basically, if you go in expecting nothing more than stuff that's meant to appeal to the characters on ""The Big Bang Theory"", then you won't be disappointed. If anything important came out of the movie, I'd say that it's Carrie Fisher's shutting down of people who have nothing better to do than comment on her age.That's all that I have to say about this movie."
ID_100310;8;9;I wanna start by saying that I'm not the biggest Star Wars fan, even though I do enjoy some of the movies more than others. I believe the original trilogy to be a fine series of films and the prequels to be terrible at times but with some good things accomplished at times. Nonetheless, from everything I had seen from the previews for this film, I was definitely anticipating it a lot and I can definitely say that it was quite a birthday present watching this on opening day. The Force Awakens was entertaining, it set up new characters terrificly and brought back the beloved heroes of the first three movies in a respectable way.With this new installment, we follow Rey (Ridley) a scavenger that has her life changed when a droid named BB-8 has an important message for a resistance fighting what rose from the fall of the Galactic Empire, the First Order. She must now deliver this message with the help of Finn (Boyega), a storm trooper that has managed to escape the First Order and Han Solo. With the First Order we will get a new villain in Kylo Ren, a Sith in training shrouded with mystery, and could ultimately play a big part in these character's lives.For me, the franchise is now in great hands as Daisy Ridley and John Boyega were wonderful in their roles and could very well be the big heroes for this new generation that Luke, Han & Leia were for the first viewers of this saga. I thought Abrams held his own in the directing department and delivered a quite competent job. The effects were on point and the movie as a whole was a fantastic piece of entertainment.As far as I'm concerned, this movie brings back Star Wars in a big way. It's not a perfect movie by any means, but its definitely quite a experience and I can see only very nit picky people not enjoying it. Having said that, I hope you really enjoy the experience like I did, if you do choose to watch it. and may The Force be with you.Rating: 9/10
ID_100311;8;9;This is literally the most beautiful film in the series. The tight shots and cinematography leave the audience with iconic, wondrous, and haunting images that stay emblazoned in one's mind. Yes, the protagonist seems a little too perfect, some of the lines are heavy handed, and some exposition of new characters seemed wanting, but the movie delivers with fast-paced movement and taps into an uncanny feeling of nostalgia for something you've never seen before by showing respect for the original films while inverting characters in new ways.
ID_100312;8;9;...., mainly because there are distinct references to relevant back stories in this film, tying certain characters together, concerning the 30 years since all events in the last movies, as there was in the original 3 movies, in relation to Darth Vader on that occasion. In order to tell these new stories fully they would have to sandwich movies in the middle of Return of the Jedi and Force Awakens, but of course they don't need to do that, allowing our own imagination to fill in the gaps, in much the same way fans, casual or otherwise, did upon first watching the original trilogy way back when, as indeed this movie does too. So, I would like to suggest that the prequels are now redundant. Having just watched the original trilogy, without all the extra gumph George Lucas tacked on to it for DVD and Bluray, seeing it in all it's VHS glory, the Force Awakens feels as though it really does belong to the original narrative, and works very well as a story occurring 30 years later. Much of that is attributed to the way this movie was filmed, using a lot of practical effects, as opposed relying entirely on CGI. There was something, I won't say what that 'something' was, that really did disappoint me, leaving me quite shocked, however in retrospect, later, I was able to appreciate all other aspects of the movie, character development, story progression, etc, and began to question if I really needed what I thought I was going to, and wanted to see.
ID_100313;8;9;I just got home from seeing it. Definitely was a great movie, a great star wars movie. First thing I want to outline, which is not really spoilerific, that there were a few things from the trailers that did not make it to the final cut. Although J.J.'s lens flares did appear (obviously) quite a lot of times, the first thing to praise is the visuals, especially the intro's visual. Also later on, all the various settings were well cured. Surely the force was strong with the direction of this film. Next on, acting of the actors. That was great. Everyone just did the best he/she could, which was fantastic. Now the most important thing in a star wars movie, besides having stunning visual effects (Wich were just really the best in this film) is the story. Many ones hated the prequels for that, and praised the originals for having great stories. Episode VII has definitely both the best story and plot and the best backstory. The 30 years of period after VI got well covered, episode VII has a lot of great elements which expanded the galaxy really well. Definitely old EU fans will see a lot of new things they won't dislike. What homever bothers and bothered me was the music. It's john williams, you can hear it, but sound more like Indiana Jones and the kingdom of the crystal skull's and harry potter's score. That's strange to be seen on a star wars film. So... overall this was a great film that earns my respect. J.J. Abrams won't be called Jar Jar Abrams
ID_100314;6;5;As I watched this, I was getting bored. Even some of the big action sequences didn't catch me. When I had left I realised why, I had seen it all before in the other installments. It didn't seem like there was anything new about The Force Awakens at all. A few scenes felt unneeded or could have at least been shortened. Some characters just seemed like fillers. I am not looking forward to the rest anymore. Maybe don't watch it or get too excited if you have seen the other Star Wars movies copious amounts.Something needs to be done about the rest of the trilogy if anything great can be said about them. So far it is dull.
ID_100315;10;10;"Wow! ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" just became the Best Star Wars movie ever made since 38 years ago. George Lucas started from the very beginning, and now he's back, of going phase 3, for the new Star Wars movie, and somehow J.J. Abrams is involved with Episode VII. He did a brilliant job in Star Wars: Episode VII, I would have to say he should stick with directing, and producing Star Wars movies instead of Star Trek, I'm more of a Star Wars fan like everybody else who loves Star Wars. J.J. Abrams and George Lucas, great job and I hope you'll do a great job making Star Wars feel the force awaken again. May the force be with you. Always."
ID_100316;10;10;"Being a long time fan of the original, prequel, and the EU I came into this movie expecting at movie that was sub par at best compared to the original trilogy but no. This film was far better than I could have anticipated! The almost spine chilling performance of Adam Driver (Kylo Ren) Daisy Ridley (Rey) and John Boyega (Finn) is superb and can keep up with the original stars like Harrison ford (Han Solo) and Carrie Fisher (General Leia/ Princess Leia). The plot might have been a little sloppy at some moments when plot devices required it but the tension you feel in the movie is so moving. My feelings after the film have caused me to feel a mix of despair and love. Anyone who doesn't cry at least 3 times while watching this movie has no soul at all, that I can guarantee. This movie rocked me so hard that I had to sit at my local theater for 20 minutes afterwards so I could process all that happened and stop my hand from furiously shaking. EU plot points, great story elements, bone chilling acting are all part of your package deal my friends and I will be going back to see it another 3-5 times. I love this movie and it just barely beats ""Empire Strikes Back"". Thanks for reading if you found this helpful please like and go see the movie NOW!"
ID_100317;9;10;"Welcome from Michael Lai's Magical Movie Reviews: ""Ahhhhhh!"" That's the sound you'll hear from the majority of Star Wars fans around the world breathing a huge sigh of relief. This is what Star Wars was meant to be, qualities not exhibited in Episodes I and II...characters you cared for, exciting action pieces not dominated by CGI, engaging plot twists and revelations plus a story that doesn't become bogged down with too much technical exposition. It's a combination of the old and the new with characters we remember and love from the original trilogy as well as new characters that have their chance to breathe a life of their own. We have the chance to reminisce with our beloved characters yet be intrigued by what will happen with the new characters. These characterizations ultimately drive the story with the action scenes helping deliver a spectacular and rewarding two hours plus of fun-filled entertainment.Set three decades after the death of the Emperor, Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) has vanished and the Resistance led by General Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher), is trying desperately to locate him before the First Order led by Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis) captures him, thus eliminating the main threat to their galactic dominance. Second in command is a Darth Vader figure in Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) who also has Force-like powers like his idol. The droid, BB8, has been entrusted with the map of the location of Luke. BB8's companion is Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac), the best fighter pilot in the Resistance. Poe is captured by the First Order but his escape is assisted by a Stormtrooper in Finn (John Boyega). Meanwhile, BB8 is separated from his companion and winds up in the company of Rey (Daisy Ridley), a young woman living on a desert planet, who is hunting for spare parts to trade for food, just so she can survive. Finn and Rey eventually team up with each other along with old favorites like Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew).This is the ultimate homage to the original Star Wars trilogy, which some people might complain about as playing it too safe. J.J. Abrams, the director and co-writer of the film, employs traits such as the slide swipe and 'eye' closing between some scenes, but it is this familiarity which will endear him to Star Wars fans. There are several scenes and plot points which you know you have seen before but you can forgive Abrams for doing this as it doesn't alienate the Star Wars fans. As a stand alone film and not comparing it to the original trilogy, it attracts the audience. For that, Abrams deserves credit for bringing in a new legion of fans. He also maintains an up-tempo rate, ensuring that there is never a dull moment. We are emotionally invested in the characters. Daisy Ridley is a newcomer worth keeping an eye on because she portrays the heroine with conviction. Her scenes with Boyega are engaging and they make us care for the fate of their characters, something that wasn't always evident in the rapport between Hayden Christensen and Natalie Portman in the CGI trilogy. Harrison Ford appears in quite a fair bit of the film and shows here how much his acting has improved since the 1977 original. The major villain in Kylo Ren is brilliantly portrayed by Adam Driver and he capably exhibits the rage and angst his character is experiencing.The abundance of CGI which detracted from the first three episodes is thankfully not in evidence here. It's a return to what made the visual effects so special in Episodes IV, V and VI. There are CGI characters (more like motion capture) like Snoke and Maz Kanata (Lupita Nyong'o) but they're never as annoying as Jar Jar Binks was. Kudos also to the sound effects team for bringing all those space vehicles to life. You'll feel like you're involved in the action. Other technical aspects to flourish include the superior set decoration, costume design, cinematography and editing, all contributing to the overall pleasures of this movie. Who could forget to mention the score by John Williams? Star Wars and John Williams go hand in hand and again, he has fashioned a score that is exciting and atmospheric. He is a living treasure and we must appreciate every score he composes, now that he is close to the end. As a side note, this is the first Star Wars film not released by 20th Century Fox and it's sad to not hear the 20th Century Fox fanfare that introduces a Star Wars movie. It's a good thing though that Disney, the studio that has acquired the rights from George Lucas, didn't include its usual ""When You Wish Upon a Star"" tune and the image of the fireworks above the castle to introduce the film. Those iconic words to begin a Star Wars film...""A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away"" will give you goosebumps. Disney plans to release a new Star Wars film in 2017. If the adventures of these characters, both and old and new are anything to go by, the next sequel promises to be an exciting chapter in the Star Wars franchise. The hype won't be as big for that installment but the hype for Episode VII has certainly been justified. http://mlaimlai2.wix.com/magical-movie-review"
ID_100318;6;5;I put 6 because of the jokes pull in the movie otherwise it would be a 5.The biggest question I have in mind is how an untrained girl can defeat a villain warlord who has years of training. Luke had training for years, Anakin had training for years. Rey had none... she did not need it.The message is if you are an independent girl you can defeat a whoever you want even without practice, just believe it.Looks like Disney and Abrams want to sell toys to girls also in order to make more money and to do that they have to twist star wars agenda to the extreme. Even Fin could stand against that villain without saber practice. In the second part I am expecting other minorities to save the universe.Perfectly disappointing.
ID_100319;9;9;STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Luke Skywalker has mysteriously vanished, leaving the Resistance in dire straits. In his absence, the First Order, lead by the evil Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), have begun implementing their will with force. Finn (John Boyega), a disillusioned Storm Trooper, absconds from his post, and joins forces with Rey (Daisy Ridley), a feisty female warrior who has in her company BB8, a droid who may hold the key to Skywalker's whereabouts. The pair are joined by Han Solo and Chewbacca in their mission as it progresses.While I've never been the biggest Star Wars devotee, I have always admired it for the great, epic film that it was, and always found it incredible how something like that could have been produced so many decades ago. Over the years, the series has certainly attracted a lot of followers, and while a lot of people have bemoaned the craze of grown adults blatantly exhibiting their passion in public, in a sense it has recreated a sense of community and kinship that a trip to the cinema has lacked for many years. The publicity for JJ Abrams big screen re-invention has certainly been pretty relentless, and you'd certainly have felt left out not going on the big opening weekend.One of the key themes of this big venture is exploring one of the Storm Troopers as a human being (they were all robots, as far as I was concerned!) and the examination of conscience that gets provoked in one of them. This creates a character ark that serves as a reference point to the story, and gives it some flair. With the fans spanning over so many years, it was necessary to create something that appealed to old and young, and so we have younger stars Ridley and Boyega, whilst returning old favourites Carrie Fisher and Harrison Ford, reprising the second of the two roles that made his name. None human old favourites C-3PO and R2-D2 return too, along with the aforementioned BB8, who resembles a Kinder Egg on wheels.The dialogue's still leaves a bit to be desired, and all the mass publicity in the world won't create any more super fans than there already are, but as a SW venture, this ticks all the right boxes, a full on, full scale epic that delivers all the marvellous effects, set design, breath-taking action and just everything you'd expect from the franchise. ****
ID_100320;6;5;Almost every elements looks so familiar to A New Hope. Too familiar. Everything is just the same. This movie is a cash-grab type of movie. JJ abrams, I hate you.
ID_100321;6;6;From a neutral perspective i would say its an OK movie. However the plot is mostly just a copy of Episode IV's plot. I didn't mind that the movie was a bit predictable, since the movie is still a Disney production - therefore also meant for children. But i did miss the force in all the fights - why not use it more, if you have it? The new characters had a decent enough backstory, but the lack of depth in the story was painful. If someone told this was supposed to be the best movie of all time, i would burst out laughing - it doesn't even deserve to be in the top 250 - Unfortunately the Screenwriters aren't as talented as the marketing managers of Disney.
ID_100323;10;10;"First and foremost: I would like for you to read my review of ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens""; but remember I don't like to leave my hand solo without writing puns in movie reviews. For those two or three humanoids who still have not seen ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"", I promise not to play the part of Darth Spoiler in my review of this riveting installment of what is probably the most popular movie franchise of all time. ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" is set around 40 years after ""The Return of the Jedi"". Three decades after the defeat of the Galactic Empire, a new threat arises. The First Order attempts to rule the galaxy and only a rag-tag group of heroes can stop them, along with the help of the Resistance. Director J.J. Abrams definitely was not spaced out with his orchestration of the movie, as he brilliantly incorporates the vintage Star Wars elements, with an invigorated new narrative. It involves a fugitive stormtrooper named Finn, who wants to put a fin to his trooper-served time; I guess he wasn't a real stormtrooper. And a pretty scavenger named Rey, who is really the reigning character of the movie; let's just say Rey's role is as pivotal as it comes in a Star Wars flick. Now for the Old School of Star Wars; yes there are sightings of classic Star Wars characters and several are imperative in the film's narrative, But I will not be the only-one can-open the secrets of their roles in this installment; I will say that young actors Daisy Ridley as Rey and John Boyega as Finn conducted forceful performances; the pressure was on and they delivered. Now to the dark side, which would come in the form of the primary villain here- Kylo Ren portrayed with edgy fierce by Adam Driver. Yea, he bad, yea, he loves the Darth. Come on, it's the dark side, what you expect! A few other laser points before I depart the Pun Star: Harrison Ford is back with his exceptionally clever badass wit with his work as Mr. Solo, and Carrie Fisher was gently effective as the former Princess now General Leia. And then there is that Luke dude.... So anyways, may the puns be with you; and yea, don't forget to watch this little space flick, if you haven't already. ***** Excellent"
ID_100324;10;10;"I just got back from the cinema. My gut tells me 10/10, of course! That was kind of obvious when feeling the hype that's been raining all over the internet these last few weeks. But where to begin, when I try to describe my emotions after watching it?Maybe I can start off with this: Star Wars fans, old and new, you will most assuredly feel a chill spreading through your body and warming your heart when you see Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher and Mark Hamill on the big white screen again, resulting in goosebumps arising on your skin while your heart pumps just a little faster from the joy. It was truly amazing to see all of these three actors back in action again. It's just so delightful to see that age isn't necessarily an obstacle for being the star of a legendary world class movie (which can gross $238.000.000 in one day.) Moving on, of course we can not forget the phenomenal new additional characters to the Star Wars franchise: Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, Oscar Isaac and Adam Driver just to mention the most important ones. I am so happy that these are the people who were casted to revive the Star Wars universe once again after a second long break (luckily, I am from the 90s, so I only had to endure one of them.) But maybe it was all for the best though; to give the franchise time to manifest itself in us for generations (talking about both my father, grandfather and me for instance.) Anyway, this new cast must also get a very big applause for their excellent work and for not being too intimidated by the franchise due to what it has become today.I would say the movie perfectly unites the original Star Wars trilogy (4-6) with the latter Star Wars movies (1-3) by recasting the SAME brilliant actors (who are still acting brilliant, despite their age) and introducing fresh, new and young actors who so eloquently live up to the high standards of their predecessors.Of course, you will also get to see the epic, mandatory light saber duel, which in this movie at least keeps up with the recent Star Wars movies. Whether or not it is as good as the Anakin vs. Obi-Wan duel on Mustafar is up to you to decide, but personally I think this one added a nice extra element to it. At last, I feel obligated to mention that Star Wars fans all over the world will be thrilled to notice certain familiar elements from the past movies (like a certain light saber perhaps; that is in no way a spoiler by the way) and much other stuff, which I will gladly send you in to watch by fully recommending it to you.So grab your family or friends and head to the movies as long as it's still on in the cinema."
ID_100325;8;10;"Finally there is a new Star Wars movie. This movie is easy to sum up without spoiling it. It is a roller-coaster ride throughout the whole movie. And yes, there are (a lot) of elements that summon a déjà vu. But those elements made us fall in love with Star Wars in the first place and once again it made me fall in love with ""The Force Awakens"". I saw it yesterday in IMAX and I am still shaking. This is my first review because I owe it to JJ. I just want to let people know to go and watch this. And form your own opinion! Don't let negative people influence your judgment...Pessimism is a path to the dark side. Stay true and may the Force be with you."
ID_100326;7;8;Gave it a 2 after first viewing, but after a 2nd look I've changed my mind. i picked up on things I missed first time which has helped produce a more objective review. jj had to squeeze so much into this film to assist with the development of the next 2. he had to appeal to 2 sets of viewers - traditional fans whilst introducing new fans to the universe, a difficult balance, but think he just about did it. its exciting, it moves at pace and harrison ford and daisy ridley are excellent. I still have some issues with it, for instance i wish we weren't dealing with another death star, but there are also plenty of mysteries yet to unveil.I'm not a star trek fan and I went to see the new star trek films with star trek fans, they were disappointed on first viewing but I loved them. this is the same. go with a child's eyes without the past to colour your judgement and you'll feel better about judging it on its own merits.
ID_100327;8;10;Star Wars: Force Awakens is one HIGHLY entertaining film and deserves tons of praise and recognition for successfully creating an exhilarating new chapter in the saga. Its cleverness & sheer novelty is sure to create a new generation of fans, & its homage to familiar icons affectionately resounds to long time enthusiasts. In amazing fashion, JJ Abrams also injects renewed energy throughout the film's runtime, resulting to a humor-filled, heart-racing experience like no other. Episode VII then, checks all the boxes, on what a resounding Star Wars sequel should be.Casting & character development is undoubtedly the film's best asset. John Boyega as Fin was such a huge win, as his eagerness and joy to be part of this film resonates in the energy of his character. His delivery was perfect, providing SERIOUS comedic punch, a pleasant & welcome surprise to the franchise. Daisey Ridley as Rey was also a fine as wine choice. Her portrayal was very real & natural, so much so that her action sequences and sentimental scenes, were effortless. By far, she is the film's heart & soul. Deserving recognition, the chemistry between the two aforementioned leads was through the roof. Their friendship felt heartfelt & genuine, and a quirk I was personally rooting for. The plot's progression through both leads, was very engaging too as they were given unique & rich backstories, and grounded motivations. Oscar Isaac as Poe was another solid casting. He oozes with righteous passion & intensity, and his scenes are electric & inspiring even. This paves the way for the audience to regard his skill & stature as entertainingly believable. Now, of course, the reprisal of Harrison Ford as Han Solo, and the inclusion of Chewie and the Millennium Falcon is THE highlight of all highlights. Amazingly, their comeback was far from being forced as their characters were given substantial roles that were integral to the storyline, steering clear from shallow fan service. Finally, we have Adam Driver who played the intimidating Kylo Ren exceptionally. His evil was haunting yet his motivations are clear and understandable, a recipe of success for any film villain.Apart from the human-factor of the film, JJ Abrams also made it a point to present Force Awakens, as a visual spectacle. The sites & landscapes were alluring, from lush forests to icey mountain sides, every location was a beaut. The action sequences was very well made and executed too, adding hearth thumping battles to complement its well thought of storyline. During dialogues, JJ Abrams also displays his directing prowess by using perfectly timed focus & pauses during sincere and emotion-filled exchanges, adding drama at the right moments.As for its shortcomings, one significant flaw that I found from Force Awakens, is its unashamed mimicry of A New Hope. Without giving away spoilers, the resemblance is uncanny. The overall un-original storyline is worry-some as fresh faces & copy pasted narratives could be a dangerous combination. This though, is a problem for its sequels. Taken as stand alone film, Episode VII was as fun & resounding as they come despite the re-hash of former ideas.Overall, this is a FANTASTIC Star Wars reboot. Every scene is brimming with energy that there is little time to breathe in between. The roles of the new and old characters were very well written & I for one, am genuinely in awe as to how these first-seen faces became overnight mainstream favorites. Cant wait for the Episode VIII and IX! Awesome job by Disney and JJ Abrams!
ID_100328;6;5;"I won't get bogged down discussing the blatant political correctness of ""The Force Awakens"" (God forbid I offend someone) and it is not really necessary to point out the obvious, but what I will say on the get-go here is that I was suckered in to the irresistible nostalgic buzz that the film offered upon it's release in 2015. Like many people, ""Star Wars"" was my childhood. So I needed a more neutral viewing some years later to really give this film the once-over. In a nutshell, I've come to the conclusion that ""The Force Awakens"" is a poor film but with a nostalgic vibe that carries it along and makes it seem to be a far better film than it really is. Nonetheless, I give it a decent rating, purely for Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher and Mark Hamill. The film is shamelessly a scene-by-scene remake of ""A New Hope""; Luke Skywalker is now a young woman and Darth Vader is Kylo Ren. And the Death Star even has a replacement. The Empire is now The New Order... I could go on, but at the risk of giving this a lower rating. Overall, this is purely one for the die-hard fans that needed the nostalgic lift a years ago. But now, and in future, I believe it will be completely forgotten about and relegated to being the lesser of the franchise, even worse than ""Attack of the Clones""."
ID_100329;6;6;That is the conclusion I came up with by the end of this new Star Wars. Long gone are the years, when as a kid, I went with my Mum and my sister to watch the Return of the Jedi. I was at the time intrigued by the Force, the Millennium falcon, Han Solo, and of course Darth Vader. But of all this, very little remains. Darth Vader well and truly gone, Han Solo is too old, the force has become weak and the Millennium Falcon is more than ever a piece of junk. This movie is obviously for Star Wars lovers. I always thought I was one, and maybe I am not. I have watched all of them from episode 1 to 7, and will continue to do so for how long as a new one is released, but unless I start watching them again with the eyes of a child, I doubt I will enjoy them the way I would like.
ID_100331;9;8;"A Stars wars kid who grew up watching the films would, but please do not let the director touch another Star Wars film or offspring move like ""Rouge One"" or ""Solo"""
ID_100332;6;6;If you are not a die-hard Star Wars fan, you won't exactly be amazed with this new episode. A lot of stuff is really predictable and formulaic. It is OK as entertainment. Newer generations will probably get a kick from this, but not someone who liked the first trilogy and is expecting something new here.There was far more drama in previous installations of the franchise, far more powerful scenes, emotional scenes, engaging and more believable characters, dialogue and yes, even fight and action scenes.It is nice to see the old familiar faces again, but that's it. Nothing spectacular or innovative. Abrams is far from Lucas' genius and this can be seen all throughout this film. It is hard to believe that Harrison Ford can't bring out Han Solo properly.If all the other movies that get churned out in these times weren't so utterly bad, I would have given this one even 5/10.
ID_100333;10;9;"Thankfully, the Star Wars franchise can get back to fun, and character, and unpredictability. After the durge created by the flaccid prequel trilogy, where there was no emotion, nor effort to wield a lightsaber, and no need to develop personality, it's great to see an unhinged evil character, an uncertain female protagonist, and an awesome droid! Fanboys will obviously lament not having back stories and canon adherence to ""the force"", or that stuffy old men aren't as prolific in this new version, but this is the way forward, not dwelling in the past. Lucas proved he was no director with EPS 1-3, so it is great to have the mantle handed over to film makers."
ID_100334;6;6;I make it high 6 only because it is part of STAR WARS franchise. This movie is a remake of New Hope. There was girl (not Jedi) but daughter of Jedi, sand planet, Chewbaca, Solo, princess and new Darth Vader (very weird kind of Darth Vader because looks funny without helmet not scary as everybody expected. Emperor also have silly name Snoke. Like i bad comedy. Fight scene of girl and call it Darth Vader is catastrophe. One regular girl not Jedi girl almost defeated Darth Vader with lightsaber?? Isn't Darth Vader guy with force powers choke? throwing objects telepathic? Story is predictable and very similar with first STAR WARS. I am shocked with high 8 for this movie from film critics. People who wrote pro film critics don't know anymore how to watch movie??? This is worst movie of all Star Wars franchise. And new Rogue 1: a story of Star Wars is much better movie.
ID_100335;3;3;I had high expectations from The Force Awakens. Initially I thought that the decision to hand over the SW franchise to a new generation was great. The new faces, the feminist twist and even creating The Force Awakens as a remake of Episode IV were not necessarily bad ideas. They were poorly executed though. I question Disney's choice of movie makers because JJ Abrams did a terrible job with the story, cast, score and pretty much everything. And he has no excuses as I am sure that he had a lofty budget. I also wonder if Lawrence Kasdan wrote the screenplay himself or outsourced it to a 4th grader from an underdeveloped country. It looks like a nauseatingly cheap comic strip with so many gaps in the plot that it almost makes me want my money back from AMC theaters. The new actors are trying hard but are unconvincing, unattractive, and unable to portray chemistry between the characters. The score is painful.I feel sorry for the kids who are supposed to be indoctrinated with this garbage. We grew up with better Stars Wars and probably better dreams. I gave it 3 stars because they brought back Han Solo and Chewbacca although even Harrison Ford cannot save this bad movie. The CGIs were decent too.
ID_100336;10;10;Star Wars: The Force Awakens continues with the Star Wars saga created by George Lucas. This movie takes place 32 years after Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi(1983). After the fall of the Galactic Empire, a new threat emerges, calling themselves The First Order. The First Order is led by the villainous, Kylo Ren(Adam Driver). Now, it is up to a couple of unlikely people like, Rey(Daisy Ridley) & Finn(John Boyega), along with the help of Han Solo(Harrison Ford), Chewbacca(Peter Mayhew) & the Resistance to put an end to The First Order & their diabolical plans for the entire galaxy. Star Wars: The Force Awakens is an epic film. Director J.J. Abrams has successfully reintroduced Star Wars to a new generation of viewers. Don't worry, Star Wars fans. Abrams makes sure that this film doesn't lose the essence of Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope(1977), Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back(1980) & Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi(1983) & what made those movies, classics. The special effects are top notch. The 3D puts the viewer, right in the middle of the action on screen. The action set pieces of the film, are one of its many highlights. The 'droid named BB-8 is another highlight of the film. Plot wise, the film has been inspired by Episodes IV, V & VI. However, the script written by, Lawrence Kasdan, J.J. Abrams & Michael Arndt adds many interesting twists & turns so that the viewer feels like this is a brand new Star Wars adventure, while also maintaining the continuity of the previous films. You will feel extremely nostalgic as all your favorite elements of the Star Wars movies are intact. The intro, John Williams' legendary background score, the Millennium Falcon, all your favorite characters & much more. I highly recommend that newcomers should at least watch the Original Trilogy, if they truly want to thoroughly enjoy this movie. The performances are another highlight of the film. Harrison Ford is outstanding as Han Solo. Even after all these years, Ford still has the charm & wit that made Han Solo my favorite character in Star Wars. Daisy Ridley is spectacular as Rey. Ridley portrays the various emotions Rey goes through in the course of the film, effortlessly. John Boyega is superb as Finn. Boyega's portrayal of his conflicted character is commendable. Daisy Ridley & John Boyega make excellent protagonists & can definitely headline more Star Wars movies. Adam Driver is brilliant as Kylo Ren. Though Kylo Ren will never be as iconic to fans as Darth Vader, Driver still gives us an extremely menacing & intimidating antagonist. Carrie Fisher is great as Princess Leia. Oscar Isaac is good as Poe Dameron. Lupita Nyong'o & Andy Serkis are amazing in their performance captured roles of Maz Kanata & Supreme Leader Snoke, respectively. Domnhall Gleeson is impressive as General Hux. Anthony Daniels & Peter Mayhew are fantastic as C-3PO & Chewbacca, respectively. Simon Pegg is hilarious as Unkar Plutt. Gwendoline Christie & Max von Sydow are effective as Captain Phasma & Lor San Tekka, respectively. Last but certainly not the least, Mark Hamill is mind blowing in his brief yet significant role, as Luke Skywalker. The supporting cast are good too. This movie is not just an action packed spectacle. Episode VII is a film with an engaging & emotional story, a generous dose of comedy altogether interspersed with spectacular action set pieces. Star Wars: The Force Awakens is a must watch, especially on the big screen. Can't wait for Star Wars: Episode VIII!
ID_100337;9;9;There really is no point trying to do an in depth review of this, it falls in line with a number of series blockbusters that are guaranteed to garner rabid responses, pro and con. The Force Awakens is a film of many flaws, it has a pungent whiff of safeness about it, the charges of it being a glitzy remake are fair enough, while certain plot strands are frustrating and set to be big talking points for years - and years - to come.Yet what about its worth to someone who is not obsessed with every finer detail? Someone who just loves the Star Wars universe as a spectacle prism of entertainment, and has just wanted a Star Wars film worthy of being fit to sit alongside that original trilogy?This made me feel 11 again, took me back to a time in 1977 when I queued for three hours to see such wonders on the big screen. The Force Awakens is, in spite of the recognised flaws, a loving homage to a past love. It's sly with humour and nods to foundations, a blitzkrieg of effects and sound work (my Blu-ray viewing had my sub-woofer doing a jitterbug in the lounge), and it doesn't shy from surprise or the dangling of the carrot.The makers have big heart and technical invention, the cast vibrant, spunky and strongly committed to the cause - the old hands a very reassuring presence - Yeah, so it's not sci-fi perfection, or any Star Wars geeks' idea of the perfect Star Wars movie (oh J.J. Abrams you devil you!), but it made this middle aged guy shed a tear of happiness. A moment to reaffirm why - as a young lad - I fell in love with film in the first place. 9/10
ID_100338;8;8;Newer SW movie is still very good and i love it. This movie is maybe little bit worse than previous ones but it's still good.
ID_100339;9;10;The most awaited film of the recent times, 'Star Wars: The Force Awakens finally arrived in India today! Being a fan-boy, I treated myself a ticket to celebrate my Xmas inside the cinema. And luckily & expectedly, the seventh installment in the main Star Wars film series, packs a solid punch!'Star Wars: The Force Awakens' is SOLID ENTERTAINMENT. Its a Blockbuster made with passion & ambition. The Writing is crisp, The Direction is tight, The Performances work & The Visual Effects are O-U-T-S-T-A-N-D-I-N-G! In short, The Force Is Stronger Than Ever!'Star Wars: The Force Awakens' Synopsis: Three decades after the defeat of the Galactic Empire, a new threat arises. The First Order attempts to rule the galaxy and only a rag-tag group of heroes can stop them, along with the help of the Resistance.'Star Wars: The Force Awakens' is a Terrific continuation to a legendary, cult legacy. The storyline is packed with several twists & turns, which by the way, offer some extremely shocking moments. I wouldn't want to spoil your fun, but all I can say is, this is the most thrill driven Star Wars flick in ages.J. J. Abrams, Lawrence Kasdan & Michael Arndt's Screenplay is arresting all through. What I loved about the narrative is that, despite the legendary characters who appear here, the story gives scope to newer characters to take the lead & particularly builds a Great Villain in Kylo Ren. And its all because the Writing remains power-packed. A special mention for the wonderfully laced humour. It compliments the goings-on so well! J. J. Abrams has lived his dream. And The Fan-boy in him has left no stone unturned to make a Blockbuster to reckon with. And he delivers, as his Direction remains tight. Dan Mindel's Cinematography is top-class. Mary Jo Markey & Maryann Brandon's Editing is very well-done. Art & Costume Design are excellent. Visual Effects are the highpoint of the enterprise. John Williams's Score is unmatchable, yet again! Performance-Wise: Its such a joy to watch Harrison Ford return as Han Solo. The Legend shines & its indeed a pleasure to watch him kick-ass. Carrie Fisher is back as General Leia Organa & so is Mark Hamill as Luke Skywalker. Their appearances are brief here, but effective. Of the newer cast, Daisy Ridley as Rey, is sensational. The actress shows tremendous potential & performs with enviable confidence. John Boyega as Finn, is lovable & contribute to some of the film's funniest moments. Oscar Isaac as Poe Dameron, is first-rate, as usual. But its Adam Driver turn as the villainous Kylo Ren, who stands out. Driver creates an all-new menace, paying a perfect homage to the Eternal Darth Vader! Domhnall Gleeson as General Hux & The Legendary Max von Sydow as Lor San Tekka, leave a mark, while Lupita Nyong'o as Maz Kanata, provides a superb vocal performance.On the whole, 'Star Wars: The Force Awakens' lives up to the expectations & offers great entertainment. Don't Miss It!
ID_100340;9;10;"Two words: loved it.
The feelings I got as a kid? Rekindled. The new characters? Awesome! The old characters? Oh yeah!
The visuals were amazing, the plot got me intrigued. Got no complaints about the acting, it all seemed to fit the individual characters imo.
Out of all of them, Rey definitely got to me the most. Her longing for a place to call home and for people to call her family and belong with is something I can understand, so I felt for her. I thought she was cool on screen, but you should hear my little ones - they were practically gushing about her (still are), and well - that sealed the deal. A new hero has risen.I DIDN'T like the rathtar stuff, but that's all I got for negative stuff. The rest blew me away."
ID_100344;8;3;Daisy earns 10/10 for her intense play. The scenes on her home planet are the best and on par with the ones in 'Hope' as well as Williams' absolutely beautiful 'Scavenger' theme. Finn is a great character and Boyega the perfect actor for it. I like also Drivers subtle performance, he's great as (already very dangerous but still unsure) Vader wannabe. Poe is also a great character and the actor plays the pilot the way I know this optimistic tough guys in reality. the bad guy general as usual in SW has not enough room in the movie to be exposed in depth but is also great play. Snoke was somewhat disappointing but OK.I was a 15 years old when watching the original movie in '78. It changed my live and influenced my choice of profession. But at this time the movie was a revolution. TFA is solid and very entertaining. I can't simply understand why some people are that frustrated. I felt great most of the time even I've missed the simple, dreamy story development of 'Hope'. But this times will never come back. Today everything is fast paced. And considering the way movies are made today, under pressure of a big company, this is perhaps the best we can get.I'm looking forward to see great scenes and moments when Rey will be teached by Luke in EP VIII. This two exceptional actors together will be able to create a remarkable moment in movie history. I hope the director and the script are able too. And Disney: go for risks! Send your marketing guys on vacations for the next release! We don't need a death star like thing twenty time bigger in there! Let the force flow through you...
ID_100346;10;10;I have read a lot of the negative comments about TFA. Mainly I see comments like: too much like the original, not enough plot, etc. It also seems some have a problem with a female lead who is strong and powerful with the force. I go to the movies to be entertained and boy was I entertained. J.J. Abrams has brought SW back to what it was originally...action packed, character based, energetic fun. Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, Oscar Isaac, and Adam Driver are absolutely fabulous as new characters and I look forward to seeing them develop in the next 2 films. There are many unanswered questions as the curtain closes on this Episode. I eagerly await the answers.
ID_100347;7;9;I got a thrill from the Star Wars opening theme. But as the movie continued it seemed like more than the opening was similar to the 1977 original. You would think trained storm troopers would not be so scatter-shot, however one of the main characters actually got hit!! Alas, it was a mere flesh wound. Don't you think you or I could hit something - anything - with a blaster? Oh well, a space opera needs it's heroes. The villain of the movie would have been more menacing had he kept the mask on until the death scene. Young love is expected in movies like this - old love is pathetic. Good thing they don't dwell on that too much. Nice to see all the originals again. I was sorry to see the ex trooper healing in bed - he was awkward in his role. Not as bad as Jar Jar Binks, but had a Wesley Crusher feel. Given his prior job on a death star that big he would have no chance at all to have the knowledge he imparted. Better to give him a hero's death. Senator, he's no Hans Solo. The new women lead was very very good. Better than a young Luke.
ID_100348;10;7;Star Wars: The Force Awakens is directed by J.J. Abrams and stars Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, Adam Driver, Harrison Ford, and Domhnall Gleeson. First off, I won't say much about the plot because in the marketing you don't know much about, all for the good reason. It's mostly about Rey( Daisy Ridley) who's a scavenger meets up with a renegade stromtrooper( John Boyega) and from there, it's an adventure. Now the acting was a little worried because Daisy Ridley and John Boyega haven't done any big movies but I have to say they were both fantastic. John Boyage was great but Daisy Ridley stole the whole movie. Harrison Ford was amazing. He wasn't just doing the movie, he was Han Solo. Adam Driver played Kylo Ren amazing, one of the best villains in Star Wars universe yet. The action scenes were great too. The lightsaber fights seemed real and it emotion to them. Now some negatives that people might have with The Force Awakens is that it repeats a lot that happened in the first Star Wars( A new hope) but to me it didn't bother me, sometimes it stands out but I didn't care, everything was amazing it truly felt like a Star Wars movie. Overall Star Wars: The Force Awakens was a fantastic movie, had that emotion like the original Trilogy had and brought new things into. The acting, action, visuals, everything was done so well. Great job J.J. Abrams
ID_100349;6;9;It starts well but it soon suffers from less creative dialogues, jokes at inappropriate moments or scenes that could be completely cut with no impact on the story. And the plot itself is the in my opinion the weakness of the movie.Spoiler alert: Just the ex trooper tells a new thing, and I liked how the son kills his father. The kill does not have to be heroic in my opinion, it feels authentic and was one moment which I didn't expect. The rest is neither surprising nor innovative. It is entertaining of course with nice effects but I expected more from another, new Star Wars episode.
ID_100350;8;8;By all accounts, this film really shouldn't work as well as it does. Looking at it in the cold light of day it is essentially a repeat of the original film in terms of narrative – albeit with some details changed and all the characters moved sideways by a generation. So we have the same parent/child divide, the same innocent discovering their power, right down to the same finale with a large planet-sized weapon. Associated with this it also rides very heavily on nostalgia and brand recognition so that we probably accept a lot of plotting conveniences that we would scoff at in a film we came into cold. However, even seeing all these things, it is hard not to love it for how well it works.It does this by getting the balanced right between all the many aspects that the film seeks to pull together. So we have the nostalgia and a very familiar narrative, but at the same time we have a story that is delivered in a way that engages and is surprisingly moving at times (albeit due to that self-same nostalgia and reliance on us already being invested in this universe and the characters). It also manages to be fun but yet also able to transition into darker moments without one damaging our enjoyment of the other. This is what makes it work I think – because it is really an enjoyable film to watch. It never really stops moving, and the characters are rather thin, but within this frame they work and are engaging.The cast are a big part of that, and it is a very well-cast piece given that the new faces are not dominated by the old familiar ones. Boyega makes good on that charisma he showed when playing the lead in Attach the Block, while Ridley is really natural and likable. For all the fuss over a black storm trooper and a female 'Luke', the truth is that both do a great job regardless of race/color – but do bring that extra factor into play (I had a daughter recently, and it did rather focus my mind on the deficient of strong female characters who are played for themselves, not for their sexuality). The cast is deep in familiar faces and really everyone is on good form – Fisher perhaps seems there because she has to be, but it was nice to see Ford manage to have a bit of a twinkle back in his eyes. The volume of familiar faces in tiny roles does get a bit distracting (particularly if you have watched any shows from Abrams and know his usual cast) but this is a minor thing since the film otherwise does a very good job of keeping you with it for all its adventure and fun.Such a hyped film with such weight on its shoulders really shouldn't be able to be so light on its feet while also delivering dramatic and emotional moments, but it does. A really enjoyable Star Wars film that delivers a lot – and regardless what George Lucas thinks, it has been a very long time since that was the case.
ID_100351;8;9;I do not understand the hate this movie has received. The critics are great. This is, very simply, a great movie. Very well-made.
ID_100352;8;6;If you ever thought that the magic of Star Wars was lost, then think again, because The Force Awakens marks a triumphant return for the series. Filled to the brim with some of the most spectacular action of the series, fascinating new characters, brilliant dialogue and stunning visuals, this is pretty much as enjoyable as Star Wars can get.The film follows the journey of Rey and Finn as they are introduced to the world of the Resistance and the First Order, as well as the legend of the war between the Rebels and the Empire. The two are both hugely intriguing characters, each with their own original backgrounds and completely convincing and fascinating motivations that makes them an absolute joy to watch.That's helped by the two stunning performances given here. John Boyega, as Finn, proves his worth not only as a great action hero, but a fantastic actor, as he gives a massively entertaining and energetic performance that you can't help but love.However, the real stand-out from this movie is the performance by Daisy Ridley, which is phenomenal. She's absolutely stunning in the action sequences, and holds her own in the dialogue sequences against veterans like Harrison Ford. She plays her character, Rey, with such clear excitement, and has immediately stamped her authority as one of the greatest on-screen presences in the entire Star Wars saga.Moving on, we've got to talk about J.J. Abrams' direction and the visual effects. There has been so much talk about the use of practical effects here, and I can tell you that it all comes to life perfectly. Mixed in with breathtaking CGI, this is most likely the most beautiful-looking Star Wars movie of all, and it's an absolute wonder to watch unfold at every moment, a real triumph in comparison to the lacklustre directing of the prequels.The only flaw that I do have with this film is in its story. Throughout, it's a hugely entertaining watch, and does almost everything that we expect from Star Wars, but what it doesn't manage is to be a non-stop thrill-ride.The first act, however, is astonishing, and features exhilarating action sequences, as well as hilarious and brilliantly-written dialogue, and easily compares to the best moments of the original trilogy.Although, as the film progresses, we lose the originality and thrill of the first act. The plot focus slightly begins to lose its way in the second act, and the third act, despite being full of incredible emotional drama and great action, just isn't as impressive, and unfortunately feels like a slight copy of the greatest moments from A New Hope.Of course, a film doesn't have to be non-stop action all the way through, as The Empire Strikes Back proved, however there are moments where this can drag a little, and it didn't quite deliver either the intrigue or fun excitement that I really wanted.Overall, though, The Force Awakens is a thrilling rebirth for the Star Wars saga, and one that will definitely go down as a great action film, a beautiful visual spectacle, and a breakthrough for two brilliant young actors, and although its plot often leaves a little more to be desired, it's still an absolutely fantastic film.
ID_100354;7;10;Just got back from a pretty early showing in Manila. The real winner here was the production design and art direction which beautifully created an up to date version of the star wars universe whilst lovingly staying faithful to everything from the earliest movies. Together with the awesome special effects and locations the movie looked stunning. Unfortunately the story and the concepts in the movie just really felt like a remake of episode iv (the original 77 movie). Many of the key elements were simply redone. As for twists and turns just think of any long running soap and you'll have an idea. The music also had some nice new pieces mingled in with the main themes. Basically this is Disney star wars nostalgia and we'll never get tired of whatever is dished up. In the same way as the 007 franchise, we will whine a little and then continue to watch the next one. Just the music themes and the sound of droids bleeping, phasers blasting, and dark lords breathing heavy will give us a rush no matter what.
ID_100355;10;10;"I wrote a review for the prequels saying that maybe George Lucas made a mistake using current world affairs as a means to tell how Star Wars came to be; trade negotiations, the war on terrorism, and the rise of imperialism in the government. But they were his mistakes to make in his legacy. But I accepted the prequels. I grew up with Star Wars. In fact, my family still has the home video recordings from when the originals aired on HBO in the 80's and I'm standing by those instead of the 2000 upgrades. As for TFA, I'm standing by it because I believe J.J. Abrams has gone back to the roots of Star Wars: good vs. evil. Before I went to see it, I asked my brother one question, 'Is there a preview scene after the credits?' I didn't want any spoilers or hints and he didn't have anything bad to say about it either."
ID_100356;1;6;"After reading some of the reviews here, I am really glad I wasn't the only one extremely disappointed when seeing this so called ""movie"". I was SO excited to see this movie. The trailers got me hooked, it looked EPIC and after watching some of the red carpet event and reading the reviews saying things like ""JJ pulled it off"" and ""This is the best Star Wars since The Empire Strikes Back"", my expectations were even higher. But within minutes of watching it, I was devastated. Something just didn't feel right from the beginning. I kept thinking this has to be a joke, that I was in a parody of the movie I paid to see. This movie is NOT a Star Wars movie, this is a Disney movie made for kids. Everything felt SO rushed with no character development and full of plot holes. Most of my friends and family were extremely disappointed as well. I hope the next director can do better, although I doubt it because Disney holds the key and will not unlock it for anyone to do anything original. Disney killed The Avengers and now Star Wars. I will no longer support Disney in any way. I will just pretend that this movie never existed and watch the other movies instead."
ID_100357;10;7;"It took me a long time to write reviews again, which is fair, because I have been going through a bit of a block lately. Since it's the first day of a new year, I guess it's fair that the first review I write of this year is last year's (actually, it came out three weeks ago) biggest hit. To be honest, I didn't expect ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" to crawl deep inside my brain and bring me back into the world of space that I remembered when I was a kid. Mainly, because I lost touch of it for a while. I wasn't born in 1977, but I remember seeing two of the three original ""Star Wars"" movies with my dad when it was re- released in 1997. Now after re-watching all 6 episodes of the Star Wars saga after seeing ""Force"", I realized that this was a world (or worlds) I couldn't leave behind. So, what's new this time? Well, Disney took over Lucasfilm, George Lucas is still retired, and it looks like the beginning of the new trilogy can definitely return to the flavor of the much-loved original trilogy (the prequel trilogy still remains quite divisive among fans). Now taken over by J.J. Abrams (director of ""Star Trek"" and its following sequel), ""The Force Awakens"" is a wonderful, exhilarating, funny, triumphant, sometimes tragic and beautifully imaginative adventure that reminded me and a lot of people who have already seen it how much we've loved and missed ""Star Wars"". We cheer for the heroes, hiss at the bad and we feel for the ones that are in-between. Plus, we get to experience worlds that Lucas and company has created 39 years ago and it still remains as vibrant and colorful and thrilling as ever. Whether you missed out or live in a cave (I don't think you're one of those people, because you've already seen the movie more than once), let me try to explain a bit of the plot without spoiling it. Set three decades after the events of ""Return of the Jedi"", a fellow Jedi that we all know and love has disappeared and the evil Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) is hell-bent on finding him and getting rid of him. Meanwhile, we get to meet some impressive new characters. Rey (Daisy Ridley) is a scavenger from Jakku who has been for looking for her family ever since she was a little girl. Finn (John Boyega from ""Attack the Block"") is a Stormtrooper who has been ripped from his family and has been sent to kill but manages to turn the other corner, as it is. Finally, there's Poe (Oscar Isaac from ""Ex Machina"" and ""Inside Llewyn Davis"") who's a pilot. Oh, wait, there's also a new droid on the scene. Its name is BB-8, who is quite friendly and helpful in every way. Joined together quite late in the process, they team up with returning characters Han Solo (Harrison Ford), General Leia (Carrie Fisher) and, of course, our favorite Wookie, Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew) in order the find the missing Jedi and to take down the First Order led by Supreme Leader Snoke (Our mo-cap superstar Andy Serkis), Ren and General Hux (Domhnall Gleeson, also from ""Ex Machina""). I was ever so reluctant to see another episode of ""Star Wars"", but after seeing it, it renewed my interest in the world of both filmmaking and ""Star Wars"". It looks as if Abrams has accomplished what Lucas did in the past, recreating the magic as if it still existed. Characters, galaxies, secrets, epic battles and plentiful twists and turns that never diminished of what Lucas had envisioned before. The only glue that remains as a big piece of the puzzle is the always unforgettable score done by John Williams. With the iconic opening theme and a few additional themes added in there as well, Williams once again creates another bit of lightning in a bottle. Nothing moved me more as I got to see Solo and Leia together again, as well as our original droids, C-3PO and R2D2. (Mark Hamill is also in here as well, but I can't reveal where he's at.) Plus the new characters are brilliantly cast. Newcomer Daisy Ridley is a star I definitely should keep my eye on. I even liked her chemistry with John Boyega, who is both heartfelt and humorous at certain turns. We don't get to see much of Poe in the movie, but Oscar Isaac brings a warm and dashing impression. But the standouts are definitely Adam Driver who brings a lot of terror and emotional depth as Kylo Ren and (obviously) Harrison Ford as Solo. This character that we loved for so long is charming, energetic and ruggedly laid-back as ever and Ford continues to make that character totally rewarding. This is a movie event I will never forget (next to ""Jurassic World"", it's easy not to overlook this). All I can say is this: I can't wait to see what Rian Johnson (director of ""Looper"" and ""Brick"") and Colin Trevorrow (director of ""Jurassic World"") can do with Episodes 8 (coming 2017) & 9 (coming 2019), because this is a fantastic saga that shouldn't be forgotten. The ""Star Wars"" saga still remains a amazing group of films that if you watch from the very beginning (I always start with Episodes I-III then Episodes IV-VI), you can see that the story still connects one way or another. I certainly hope to see this movie again. Probably because I want to pick up on some of the hidden secrets that are hinted at. Also, I want to be overwhelmed by the amazing visuals, memorable characters and incredible worlds. Another ingredient to add into this is that the Force has been passed down from one generation to another. With ""The Force Awakens"", it just shows that the force is definitely with us, forever and always. And I'm glad that I got to be a part of it again."
ID_100358;10;9;I will warn you all now that I am a little bit biased when it comes to Star Wars. But not even I can fully defend the prequel trilogy. There were some good moments in and acting them (McGregor for one). But they were in essence just about trying to tell us what we already knew i.e. that Darth Vader was going to the dark side. Not much more was gained than that unfortunately.So 32 years after what I would consider the last really good star wars film (Return of the Jedi), The Force Awakens(TFA) has been released, but is it actually any good. Well from my already stated viewpoint (A bit biased) I would say it was absolutely brilliant. I will not give any spoilers away today. Another review will be coming next week after my 2nd viewing. So this review will just cover basics about the Director, cast etc.When I heard that J.J. Abrams was hired as the director I was very happy. Though some people (Mainly Trekkies) did not like his take on Star Trek, I thought they were very good re-envisioned films. I also like most of what he did on Lost. You can tell he decided to make the films as Lucas did with the original films and should have done the prequels i.e. with some TLC. From having an actual Millennium Falcon built to using actual locations as per the original and not all CGI led. Most importantly, He hired Lawrence Kasdan (responsible for scripting Empire Strike Back), this was a master stroke as this guy knows how to write a good script. The vistas are also beautiful thanks to cinematographer Daniel Mindel.The sound effects and the score (John Williams) is as ever brilliant. In fact Williams score is one of the things that is great about the prequels and he does not disappoint again here and is one area that may get an Oscar nod along with special effects and cinematography.The most important part (along with the script) Abram's had to play along with the producers was to hire a good cast. This is an area I was very worried about as Lucas got this very wrong with his main character on 2 occasions in the prequels. Both Jake Lloyd and Hayden Christensen were poor as Anakin. Here in TFA there are lots of new characters, so trying to blend them all in with the older established characters (Han, Leia et al), would not be an easy task.I am very happy to say that casting is not an issue. From 2 young British actors in Daisy Ridley and John Boyega (Attack the Block) as well as Oscar Isaac (Ex Machina), to the more established Ford and Fisher. They even manage to fit in a General Hux (Domhnall Gleeson (also Ex Machina and Harry Potter)), to keep me happy.It is plain to see that there is brilliant chemistry between the cast, it is difficult to fake that on-screen. I have sometimes found Ford looking disinterested in recent roles, but there must be something about the role of Solo that has brought the best out in him again as he was excellent, he with Ridley and Boyega are the stand-outs for me (On the Light-side anyway). Though Isaac is again brilliant as he in most of his films. One final mention has to also go to Adam Driver as Kylo Ren (TFA's villain), I will go more into his performance in part two if this review next week. But suffice to say he is an excellent heir to Vader and he also has a great lightsaber :). I would highly recommend going to the to see this (Though maybe not at midnight), its one of those films that needs to be seen in the cinema. It is a fun thrill ride of a movie with all the right Star Wars ingredients. Yes it does pander a little bit to fans (That's the only spoiler I will give), but there is plenty here for all to enjoy and love. The one issue you may have is you will most likely have to have seen the original trilogy before coming to see this (If you haven't already).
ID_100359;10;2;This movie is the Star Wars sequel we needed! Perfect sequel of where the old movies ended. A new generation, a new threat, a new adventure!
ID_100360;8;10;Star Wars Episode VII The Force Awakens focuses on Nostalgia of the original trilogy using elements and aspects from the original trilogy to introduce both old and new characters. The original storyline parts mesh well with borrowed aspects, Disney played safe for sure when making the movie, regardless it came out well. Although some of the new acting choices are questionable, its still an enjoyable beginning of a new trilogy.Both new and old Star Wars fans will enjoy this new addition to the Star Wars universe.
ID_100361;7;8;Let me keep this to the essentials.Is it worth seeing? Yes.Will it change your life? No.Is it better than Eps I-III? Yes.Is it better than Eps IV-VI? No.What's particularly awesome? Han Solo, super fast pace, retro chic, sound effects.What's particularly lame? Kylo Ren, British accents galore, lazy story, too much deja-vu.Totally worth the ticket and tons of fun if you don't expect the time of your life.
ID_100363;10;10;"""42"" unhelpful votes, there is cheating going on here. Don't mistake continuity of story and universe with ""reboot or rehash"" - This is a story that continues on from the end of Return of the Jedi"". We are not worried about The Force being explained anymore, we don't care - It's a mystery and back to being a mystery. It starts with a simple enough premise: The Empire was defeated and their end Death Star obliterated, but as always, in fiction as in true life, when old bad guys are killed off, new bad guys take their place.This is not a universe that is ""in the same condition as it was in Eps IV, V, and VI"" - As there is a new republic, there is also a new group of imperialists and fascists that want to tear it down. It's happening in the US this very day, so this is nothing new.I suspect these negative reviews are just the spewings and ramblings of anti-JJ Abrams shills, doing the same as they did for Star Treks I and II. Because there are NO kiddie elements in this new Star Wars, it is a story aimed at long term fans of the franchise and it hits with a bullseye. What surprises me, is ALL of the 1-star reviews say EXACTLY the same thing. Because they were not written by 100 guys, but by ONE guy AS ""100"" guys. The main thing here is ""Where is Luke Skywalker"" - And both bad guys and good guys want to know the answer to this. So do We. These include some of the old regulars, plus a new bad guy who wears a Helmet that looks like the Ugly Narc-Alien from Episode IV, who narced on Hans Solo to Imperial Storm Troopers and particularly Jabba the Hut. In an early confrontation in this episode, this duck faced guy takes out Max Von Sydow who indicates this person came from the Good side of the Force.So to me it's just continuity, as there are Jedi who followed Luke and his mentor Obi-Wan, any new recruit that goes down the Dark Side ends up doing Darth Vaderish things, like killing Off a whole school of Jedi Kids.As in life with often repeated scenarios, that keep on repeating over and over, this is just the same in the Star Wars universe. I'm not worried about that, what's important here is ""Does this film play out like original Star Wars""? And yes, it does.And although this film includes people from Eps 4, 5, and 6, this is a new story, and so there are two new players, a girl, who is waiting on a crummy sand planet, and a storm trooper, who turns away from his programming because he wants something better. And there is something about this Kid, do we know *his* father?The imagery is pure original Star Wars. The gadgets, the Droids, the Crashed Imperial Destroyers. New and Old Aliens, in new and old Bars.I very much wanted to know who this girl was, and I very much wanted to know about this kid who walked away from being a storm trooper. In the Meantime, it was great to see Han, Chewie, and Leia, who have scars of age and experience. At one time, they were the young ones who had the responsibility laid on them, in this episode, it is the girl and the boy. Because in real life it is always the young choosing to do good, who have long term effects, who save Nations in some cases. It's generational, the old guard passes it on the the new guard. If you live in this world, you're feeling the change of the guard - As the old song says.That's what this episode is, although there is a major victory, it is at major cost. And although the old Empire had built two powerful Death Stars, those were nothing compared to a new threat. It's a death star on steroids. So some ask, why make new Death Stars? Why have one in this movie? Because, it's the limited thinking of The Imperialists and Fascists. Because they always go back to comfortable norms for weapons design- In their Supreme Leader's small thinking, another huge planet sized weapon with a huge GUN.I saw this in IMax, in 3D, and I was impressed with how each 3D gag was well thought out and well placed. My brother kept trying to reach out and touch the tip of the Imperial Destroyer. A film shot in 3D has to look good also in 2D, and this does, in the IMax theater I could occasionally pull off my glasses and see a 2D Scene, and the composition in 2D was just as good. I'm not really a fan of 3D films, you can't really call them films anymore, as they are made on all digital medium. But for this episode, it worked well.In Lucas's overblown Eps I II and III, the CGI was over the top and blatantly CGI. IN this film, the CGI blends with the practical elements so that you absolutely cannot tell which is which. And also in Eps I II and III we have a multitude of scenes which are boring discussions explaining the force, mainly people sitting on couches talking. That, to me is about exciting as eating a plate of Tripe! I guarantee you, you will NOT see any Jedi sitting on couches talking in this one. Or Senators, or Sith Lords. This film is action from start to finish- about 2 and a half hours worth.And after walking out after the last scene and the film credits, there is no way in hades or Tattoine, that this will not have sequels. And this episode deserves to have sequels. And I for one cannot wait for those to come out!"
ID_100364;8;10;Although I'm not a great fan, with time I really became obsessed about this universe, and that movie is one of the bests, they have all the references, the olds characters (more evolves) and new ones pretty well work, the visual effects is nostalgic and so much better also, the story is totally understandable, and you really will enjoy this adventure.
ID_100365;10;10;Isn't a little suspicious that a movie that has 95% approval by critics and 93% approval by fans at RottenTomatoes, a 81 score at Metacritics and a 8.7 overall score at IMDb has so much 1/10 stars reviews at the IMDb user reviews section? This section has been invaded by trolls. No doubt about it.I've watched this movie 3 times already and people always leave the theater with huge smiles in their faces. The Force Awakens is all about enjoying the ride — and what a ride! JJ Abrams achieved an impossible mission: he honored the past by setting the ground for the future without pissing off hardcore Star Wars fans.The pace of the movie and the witty dialogs makes the story fly. Much better than Return of the Jedi and (I dare say) the original Star Wars, The Force Awakens is all fans and non- fans have been waiting for.
ID_100367;9;10;"Greetings from Lithuania.""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" (2015) is a blast off entertainment from start till finish. I'm not a huge Star Wars fan, so i kinda wasn't in the whole hype surrounding this sequel, but nevertheless i was also caught but all the fuzz, saw the trailers more then once and was waiting and wanting for this movie. I saw this movie with couple of friend who are a true Star Wars fans, and they were a bit disappointed by this movie. They complained that is made not much sense as a sequel, and maybe wasn't even true sequel, but from my point of view, it did many things that a sequel, which budget is 200 000 000$ and much of the new franchise's right owners future is at stake, right. It plays safe in terms of story, it is visually stunning movie (Oscar award without doubts), features tons of action, plenty of very good humour, returning iconic characters, some moving scenes and combine it with some nostalgic moments - this is a winner. Overall, as not a Star War fan i give this movie 10/10. I do believe, that if i would have been a ""fanboy"", score would have been lover. It has almost everything that a fun and great popcorn entertainment must have - simple and sharp characters, tons of action, superb effects, great humour, interesting (even if not very menacing villains), involving story and a sense of nostalgic to a previous movies if you have seen them. Next movie is scheduled for 2017. Can't wait."
ID_100368;8;9;"It's finally here - something that some fans have been waiting 32 years for! (Although the last theatrically-released Star Wars film, 'The Clone Wars', only came out seven years ago). Since I wasn't born until after 'Return of the Jedi' and grew up watching them on VHS and am a pretty big fan, the sequel trilogy (as opposed to the prequel trilogy) and 'The Force Awakens' has long been hoped for.OK, let's see if I can do a vague storyline with no spoilers... 30 years after the Battle of Endor, Han (Ford) is the first 'original' we're reintroduced to - well, technically Stormtroopers are, followed by the Millennium Falcon. But first, we meet Poe (Issac), an X-Wing pilot for ""the Resistance"" (the new Rebel Alliance); BB8, a ball-like droid; Finn (Boyega), a former Stormtrooper; and Rey (Ridley), a scavenger, barely surviving on the desert world of Jakku (which plays a role in the 'Lost Stars' novel, well worth a read!). BB8 holds some important data and needs to get it to Leia (Fisher), before the ""First Order"" (the new Empire) and Kylo Ren (Driver) get it, so they can all find Luke (Hamill). The only ones missing are Lando & Wedge.It feels like a lot has changed, but also not much at all - it truly feels like the original Star Wars universe, with plenty of new aliens, spaceships and droids, but also plenty of old ones. Abrams has definitely nailed the tone, with plenty of adventure and zest, and also some humour and drama. The pace rarely sags and it doesn't feel like two & a bit hours, but nor does it try to cram too much in. It's not exactly a carbon copy of 'A New Hope', but definitely borrows a lot of themes from it.Some questions are answered, but are lot are left unanswered, so the anticipation remains for the next films. While the film is definitely a great movie - and far better than any of the prequels - I sometimes didn't feel as if as much was at stake as it was in the originals and a few things didn't sit 100% right, also probably a by-product of my high expectations. Still, Ridley & Boyega are both very good to watch and valuable additions, and Driver's intriguing - I look forward to watching their characters grow in Episodes VIII and IX."
ID_100369;6;8;"First of all, I have to say like mostly everyone I loved the new characters especially Rey and Finn. I think they'll be a great addition to the SW universe and I'm looking forward to where future films take them. After the first time I watched this movie on opening night, I was ecstatic. I left the theater with a huge grin on my face because I knew that JJ Abrams made a movie that was better than any of the Lucas-directed prequels. Unfortunately after seeing it a second time, I noticed the flaws A LOT more because now I could focus more on the plot and pick up on anything I may have missed the first time. As many have already pointed out, at times this film is very similar to Star Wars Episode 4: A New Hope. Sometimes it feels TOO similar to the point where it just gets distracting and you can't help but feel the writers/director just wanted to play on the audience's nostalgia. I would compare it to a used car salesman trying to sweet talk me into buying a car he knows is in bad shape but plays on my emotions to get me to buy it. Similarly, JJ tries to play on the audience's love of the original trilogy to somehow make us forget that really nothing much happens in this movie. By the end of it I was left wanting more and not in a good way but more of a ""that's it?"" kind of way. This movie's primary purpose was to introduce us to this new group of characters and get us to love them so that we buy tickets to see the next films. It succeeds in doing so, but fans of Star Wars deserve a lot more than that."
ID_100370;9;9;Star Wars: The Force Awakens is an outstanding movie with a very well developed plot and a stellar cast. There's no denying how big the hype for this film really was, and it made me quite nervous as my love for the series was setting the bar high, but I wasn't one bit disappointed. The magic of Star Wars is back, the magic that I have always complained was missing from the prequel trilogy. The tone is similar to A New Hope in which it sets up a new adventure, beautifully, and it will leave you wanting more. Of course, with a film as anticipated as this, you are going to find flaws, and the Force Awakens does have a few significant ones, the one that bothered me the most was Andy Serkis's role, his character was confusing to say the least. He didn't feel like he belonged in this universe, it felt more like a Harry Potter character. Hopefully they will establish him and make some sense of it in future films, but for now I am left scratching my head at all his scenes. R2D2's character arch in the film is very messy, I will not reveal anything, all I will say is that the writers did not spoon feed us any information on what was going on with him. Lastly, one of my biggest pieces of criticism, Kylo Ren is not a likable villain, not like Darth Vader was. He does not have the kind of traits Vader, as well as Darth Maul and Count Dooku, had that made us root for them at times, with Ren you want him to be defeated as soon as you are made aware of his motives, lots of villains are like this, but with Star Wars I have come to expect more likable bad guys.The cast is outstanding. The new members, Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, Adam Driver, Domhnall Gleeson, among many others, are brilliant new additions to the franchise, their characterization in their respective roles is fantastic, they are all top notch performers. The returning members are all a delight to see in their iconic roles, I was skeptical about Carrie Fisher and Mark Hamill returning as Leia and Luke, but it was as if they never left, very natural. Anthony Daniels and Peter Mayhem will also bring a smile to your face. My favourite part of the entire movie had to be Harrison Ford. There are many brilliant characters in this series but Han Solo will always stand as my favourite, mainly because of how well Ford portrays him, and this movie is no exception. He slips back in to the role perfectly and did not seem one bit nervous, even with this being his first time playing the character in 32 years. The moment he is on screen you can feel that he is back in character, and he steals every single scene. Action packed, intense and compelling, Star Wars: The Force Awakens can not be missed by any fan of the series, and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a good action, adventure or sci-fi film. A new threat arises thirty years after the events of Return of the Jedi, but a new group of heroes may be able to stop them, with the help of some familiar faces. Best Performance: Harrison Ford
ID_100371;7;2;"I went to the cinema last night and here's my personal review:In general: None of the characters is getting developed during the plot. All of them are fully explained and equipped with all their attitude and feature sets within the first five minutes of appearance.Kylo Ren, the villain: isn't threatening at all. I feel sad for a youngster who's apparently been hanging around with the wrong guys and is gotten weird in his puberty. But I'm not impressed. He's just a nervous kid who has never learned to control his temper, angrily destroying things in his room when he gets upset. To me he's more like Biff Tannen in the ""Back to the Future"" franchise.Rey, the girl: is just as stubborn, insolent and ludicrously high gifted as all movie heroins are. She's so scrawny she can hardly hold a gun, yet she's winning every fight easily. Oh my god.... Well, at least she PILOTS like a woman ;)Flinn, the guy: is stupid and clumsy. I wonder how he survived his time as a soldier. And I wonder why I should be continuously watching him failing over and over again. I feel sad for him.The girl and the guy: I guess Disney wanted to turn the role model wheel 180°, making the skinny young girl a fighter and the fighter a foolish young girl. For me such absurdity is utterly hard to watch without holding and shaking my disenchanted head.Lor San Tekka, Max von Sydow: Why is he, the perfect Obi-Wan Kenobi character successor, in the movie only for about five minutes?--Why is every film aimed at 12 year old children nowadays? Why didn't the creatures in the carrier hurt someone?Most of the excitement, suspense and sobriety in a movie comes from characters not talking. But all of the characters in the movie - just - didn't - stop - talking!No ambiance or mute suspense scenes are depicted whatsoever. No fade or wipe as been applied, too. So there's no chance whatsoever to get John William's excellent score to interact with the audience.Everyone was acting so fast and nervously. Gee, I felt like being in a nursery from all the unnecessary stupidity and cheer that's been said.What's so great with Chewbacca's crossbow which Han Solo didn't see earlier in all these years?Everyone in the movie is talking and behaving too nervously and fast. The only ones with a great timing were Han Solo - and Snoke in particular.The Chewbacca character is giving a plain stupid idiot. Just like the Finn character does.BB-8 is behaving like a little dog. No cleverness whatsoever. He's unnecessary from the beginning. It would have been more reasonable to put the USB stick into a box and hide it in the sands than to introduce the BB-8 character for this.I would have preferred if a Muppet would have been used for playing Maz Kanata. These CGI characters just don't have soul. I bet no child would like to have a Maz Kanata puppet in their bed.Why is the chess board (Dejarik) on board the Millennium Falcon playing all of a sudden - WITHOUT players?--And here's my review to the horrible German translation of the flick:""I'm a Stormtrooper"" has been translated into ""ich bin ein Sturmtruppler"" - Huh? ""Sturmtruppler""??? Really? So the German translators didn't know how to translate a German word into German?? In English this would be like calling him a ""Stormtroopling""! Gee!! ... Who came up with that idea?? Why didn't they let him say something reasonable like: ""ich gehöre zu den Sturmtruppen"" which may be translated as ""I'm belonging to the shock troops""?!?Same for ""The First Order"": They translated it into ""Die erste Ordnung"" which sounds just like ""The First Orderliness"" in German. Gee!! What did they think this is? Isn't the house cleaning company nearby called like this? I hardly believe the director of the German version really knew what he/she was doing... A more appropriate translation into German would have been something like ""Das neue Regime"".It must have been nitwits who did the translation. Didn't they know that the Empire is a allegory to the Third Reich? Come one, guys, this isn't Lord of the Rings!Moreover, I don't know about Kylo Ren's English voice, but the German voice has been badly set. Too much intonation, he is talking too quickly. His voice is just too vivid and nervous to be evil. Given that voice, wouldn't he be better off singing when he tortures others? (After all, it's a Disney flick, isn't it?)Same for the silvery ""Stormtroopling"". He's a ""she"" - and she's talking with a high pitched girl's voice! Urgh!! I couldn't hold myself laughing when she'd be giving orders.Not to mention the voice of Maz Kanata. She's got the voice of a young woman! But does she look like one?? To me she rather seemed and felt like a female Yoda. And that's what I would have expected from her voice: The voice from someone having a voice like one of the Golden Girls actresses. Or Roseanne's as it is now.--One positive thing: There *really* is a great deal of true hardware and makeup done in the movie. And it was great to see the Millennium Falcon interior with all the traditional switches and levers - and WITHOUT a touch screen!However, the amount of CGI in the movie is still 99 % compared to real hardware/makeup.--I'm very much looking forward to get a hand on the DVD. As soon as I get it I will cut all the hooey and girlish stuff out, add length by slowing down some scenes and create my own grown-up version of the flick."
ID_100372;7;3;"*SPOILERS* The film alone is watchable, although there is certainly nothing remarkable about it whatsoever. I wont be re-seeing it. A major flaw with the movie is the rather poor story, which includes the usual Abrams plot holes and zero subtleties which are what hold peoples imagination as he seems on a mission that the everything be dumbed down to the lowest common denominator. That the plot actually shares many parts nearly identically with SW ANH cannot be denied, and it was probably done intentionally as a slight tribute/""re-dedication for a new generation"" - oh yay!hooray for nostalgia!... or rather, how about a new story?! Character development: none. Yes, everyone knows they can't give the audience all the information, but really that lack of information on the back story in this film was bizarre and off-putting. The pacing: disjointed. Completely missing is the ""Star Wars feel"" with the intense battle of the Dark and Light side, that even the much-maligned prequels still manage (see ""Duel of the Fates etc). Also, I cannot remember any of the soundtrack after seeing the movie - even the Phantom Menace featured unbelievable scores.Among the most unforgivable of the film are the plot holes that will even have the casual Star Wars fans in disbelief:Here are a few a can still remember: It's all well and good Disney and Abrams slapped the Star Wars fan base in the face by ""un-canonizing"" all of the Expanded Universe literature...but they can't use that excuse for this one -Luke Skywalker would never run away from a Sith that he is responsible for training, especially his nephew.-a ZERO-trained very powerful force user - just nope...I mean, even Anakin Skywalker had to train and there was a Force prophecy about him!-Non-force user non-clone storm trooper using a lightsaber for the first time rather spectacularly against a Sith trained by Luke Skywalker!-non-trained powerful force user, also a lightsaber novice, also manages to defeat a trained Sith lord...folks, do we remember SW ANH where Vader strikes down Obi Wan or SW TPM, where Darth Maul strikes down Qui Gon and almost defeats Obi Wan - yeah, Force Awakens lightsaber duels are a total insult to those... -Kylo Rens light saber not only looks like a joke, but it's design would actually lead to the saber's destruction during a duel as the perpendicular beams are emitted from nodes sticking out at the base of the main blade...ie. as soon as an opponents blade grinds down to the hilt it will be naturally directed to slicing into the lightsaber handle...and also nobody asked for a cheesy lightsaber...Small squadron of old beat up fighters beating an Armada - nopeHow does the resistance all of a sudden no where the weapon planet is? And why didn't they try to destroy it WAY before!!!Aside from the lead, she was pretty good, the acting was sub-par, especially the actor going on about imaginary complaints about a black Storm Trooper...(it was ironic HE was the one making the biggest deal about it!). His ""coming to morality"" killing the village scene nearly ruined the movie for me it was so bad - not only the acting but the 3 finger blood streak was also lame cliché and looked really fake bad.Acting:7 CGI:7 Soundtrack:6 Script:5 Plot:5.5 Character Development:4 Pacing:4Who will bring balance to the Force now?"
ID_100373;8;9;"This is the movie ""you've all been waiting for"", a grand, classic early 80s Star Wars sequel complete with analogue grain, and the exact same music, credits, shots, battle sequences, characters, plot devices and themes.The movie also has some new spins, details and depth during the battle sequences, and luckily, it IS an emotionally powerful piece of drama, the third act is palpably effective.Is it worth seeing? Well, in the 35 years or whatever since Star Wars came to the screen, there's been a lot of developments in making stylized, fx-heavy violence and spaceship battles on screen, so the movie mostly relies on expensive modern production values that look convincingly like the original Star Wars universe. Also, the story beats happen faster, which in a sense rob depth of a fantasy series that didn't have much in the first place, and often the action sequences smack of frames and stand-offs from the old series.I DID SAY, however, that it has guts. The film feels real, and compelling, and has a sense of drama that relates to the real world, also its commendable that the film has a strong female lead and an African American dude is prominent throughout, although that's not in itself innovative in 2015, its still a nice idea to bring some diversity to the Star Wars franchise, also adds dramatic possibility, something George Lucas clearly had no grasp of in his ""prequel"" trilogy launched in the late nineties.Anyway, writing about Star Wars is a bit like ""dancing about architecture"" to borrow a Frank Zappa phrase on the role of critics, go see it: if you like Star Wars, you'll love this movie. Older viewers, or really anyone familiar with the early installations will occasionally wince at the fact that the movie is nearly entirely a clone of some sort - perhaps the first big reboot of a popular series that's really a note-for-note remake.Generally good acting though, and decent budget, as you'd expect from Disney/Lucasfilm megacorp."
ID_100374;10;10;"I guess like every fan of the ""Star Wars"" saga, I eagerly awaited this new movie, and was not disappointed (much). I waited long enough until the massive crowds died down enough that I could finally see the picture and not have to worry about sitting in a heavily crowded theater and being constantly distracted by everything that comes along with a large crowd.Alas, I was but one of five people at a 1:15 P.M. showing at my local theater.With the eagerly awaited 2015 ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens,"" I can say that ""Alias"" J.J. Abrams has fashioned a reasonable sequel to the original ""Star Wars"" trilogy that began in 1977 and ended in 1983, as well as the much-beleaguered prequel trilogy that began in 1999 and ended in 2005.The film is not the prequel trilogy and doesn't contain any of its silliness, but it falls short of the epic grandeur of the original trilogy. It's really somewhere in the middle, if you really want to think about it. But I guess, if we were to have a continuation of ""Star Wars"" following the conclusion of ""Return of the Jedi"" (1983), then this was it.This new film is very much a return to the tone and style of the original trilogy, and features a great many nods to those films, while still in other ways continuing the story.People, and George Lucas (creator of the ""Star Wars"" saga), have speculated for years that a follow-up to the original trilogy would be something like ""The Force Awakens,"" where a time after the conclusion of ""Return of the Jedi,"" we would return to many of the principal cast members and some new, fresh faces to the saga, as well.I wasn't disappointed, but aside from a few minor quibbles, this was a worthy entry into the ""Star Wars"" cinematic saga. I look forward to ""Episode VIII"" in a few years.10/10"
ID_100376;10;10;But that's what makes this J.J Abrams Star Wars movie so great. It borrowed heavily from the original trilogy, making us all feel like kids again and feeling nostalgic. It lays down the same groundwork, the same plots, and allows us to explore the same galaxies/ environments and settings for this galactic space drama for the upcoming sequels. Yet it introduces us to brand new characters that will carry this franchise forward to the new future of star wars.I love Daisey Ridley portrayal of Rey as a down on her luck scruffy scavenger who had a very tough upbringing being all alone and forced to survive based on instincts. I like John Boyega who provided a convincing portrayal of a storm trooper that has gone rogue and who have renounced the First Order evil ways. I like how Lupito animates the smuggler queen, Maz Kanata with her intelligence and yet warmth towards old friends and those in need. Overall the plot points are very similar to Star Wars: A New Hope and it plays out almost the same way except with less star ships? (Whats up with that?) It leaves me wanting more and leaves me with that warm fuzzy feeling of being back in my childhood and relieving that star wars grand story and setting again to be in a fantasy world. SO yes it is absolutely amazing and I loved every minute of it and i would highly recommend the movie to everyone.
ID_100377;6;6;This one gets lots of hate because it had a familiar story but it did its job and got me hyped for the next saga film. The big shocker is kinda sucky but I understood it from a three film narrative and character building. Sadly all of it was squandered in the end.
ID_100380;10;10;I'm not going to say much about this outstanding sequel film, but this Episode 7 alone rips the last three apart with the force! LOL!The last three were pretty good, but this one Jedi crushed em all! I can't wait for episode 8! A mash up on the classic film and the new ones, which in turn is absolutely amazing!!The cast were phenomenal!Story and action are perfect!Im not a big fan but i think i am now!Definitely getting this on blu-ray!
ID_100381;8;10;The Force Awakens is better than all of the prequel trilogy movies. It has a lot of scenes that are similar to A New Hope. That doesn't effect the movie in a negative manner but boosts the audiences interest in it. The characters are amazing and the reveals are brilliant. They make X wing pilots cool and bring a whole new take on the story that does a great job at continuing the story from the original trilogy. I felt a lot of emotion watching this and am glad that a new generation will be introduced to Star Wars in such an amazing way. I grew up watching the prequel trilogy and it did its job at hooking the next generation on the Star Wars saga. This sequel trilogy will continue to add a new generation to this saga.
ID_100382;6;7;I'll start by saying I'm far from being a 'Star Wars' fanatic, or for that matter even really a fan. I happen to have seen all the movies to date and can appreciate them for what they are, but they are not really my preferred cup of tea. Hell, it took me almost 12 months to get around to seeing this entry into the series. All that said, I was still a little bit disappointed by 'Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens' simply because I expected more. I expected more in the way of a complex story and I expected more in the way of new characters. 'Kylo Ren' really didn't do it for me as the main villain. Obviously he had huge shoes to fill the terms of 'Darth Vadar' (this is even touched on in the movie), but I still feel like a better job could have been done. Also the story, while pleasantly easy to follow, felt like it was lacking in creativity. When your come to a 'Star Wars' movie you're prepared for a little bit of complexity.What I did really enjoy was the pacing of the film. It has a 136 minute run time and yet it feels like your standard 90 minute film, because it just flies by. When the credits rolled I remember thinking to myself moments before that there must be about 30 minutes to go. Daisy Ridley also immensely impressed me as the main protagonist. She was likable, charismatic and impressive in the action scenes. The only work-on for her before the next film would be her line delivery at times comes across a little fumbled. That shouldn't be too hard to fix.It's hard for me to guess how true 'Star Wars' fanatics are going to feel about this film, but I can tell you that for average folk like myself it's a watchable experience, but not a lot more.
ID_100383;9;9;"This review of ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" will be necessarily brief, for fear of spoilers. And when I say ""fear of spoilers,"" I really do mean FEAR of spoilers. There are people out there who will burn your house down if you ruin this long-awaited film's surprises.I really liked it. I would somewhat grudgingly give it a 9 out of 10, as I can't match the sheer ardor its global legions of fans. (Yes, ""Star Wars"" was a big part of my childhood, but I have more or less gotten over it. I read last night, for example, that filmmaker Kevin Smith actually cried upon stepping aboard the Millennium Falcon when he visited the set; I am not quite as nostalgic as that.)In short, it absolutely succeeds as a fun space fantasy, and recaptures the spirit of the original ""Holy Trilogy."" It easily surpasses the much-maligned prequels on nearly every level, including screen writing, acting and special effects. The predominance of practical effects over those that are exclusively digital make this movie's universe feel ""real"" and ""lived in.""We finally have relatable characters again who sound real, and who can invite viewer sympathy. The dramatic interaction among our newer heroes and returning icons is both logical and emotionally involving. I was surprised at how well this movie handled the passing of the torch. It was a kind of skilled storytelling that was almost entirely absent from the last three films. And the special effects were top notch.My only mild quibbles might reflect a greater degree of objectivity that you might hear from someone who is not a raging fan of the series. This film so closely parallels the original ""Star Wars"" (1978) that at times it started to feel like a remake. Were the similarities in structure, characters, plot points, planets and villains all an intentional homage? I suggest that our bad guys here, for example, sometimes feel interchangeable with those of past ""Star Wars"" films. I want to say more, but can't, because of spoilers. Am I the only person who noticed these things?I also submit that, like a few other ""Star Wars"" movies, our characters are rendered with little depth, with sparse information about their skills, motivations, backgrounds or ideosyncrasies. The dialogue is thin. Consider lines like ""He's my friend!"" and ""Because it's the right thing to do."" And we are presented with no information why the speaker here is so noble, when others are not. Even if the screen writing here is better than the prequels, it's still not Tennessee Williams.It's all very forgivable, I guess, just so long as the viewer remembers that they're sitting down to an installment in a film franchise originally intended for young people. It's kid stuff. It's really, really good kid stuff, but it's kid stuff. (Don't burn my house down!)And the reason I chose a 9 rating instead of an 8 was primarily the enjoyment I got from seeing familiar faces. The return of our icons was surprisingly well depicted and, if you loved ""Star Wars"" as a kid, then that should be enough to make this a ""must-see"" movie."
ID_100384;6;9;The Force Awakens is an exciting new chapter to the SW saga. But there are problems, which it would be easy to get overly critical about. First off, what they got right about this film. New characters: on the surface they're different and compelling enough to enjoy. But at times they lack depth (and maybe even maturity). Perhaps that was by design to appeal more to kids. Next (what I like to call) environmental moments! An example of that is in #1 when Anakin is pod racing, a group of sand people are watching & take a shot at one of the pod racers, causing him to crash. Or in #4 when on Tatooine, they enter Mos Eisley in Luke's land speeder, a Jawa can be seen struggling to control a Rhonto beast. It seems like unimportant details, but it goes a long way to making SW seem real (and not just some visually impressive trip thru a fantasy universe)! While not achieving a George Lucas level, JJ Abrams did a respectable job at this, and frankly I don't know if other directors would've even grasped that. As always, the special effects & sound effects are top notch. The action and pace of the movie are done well too. If anything it could've slowed down in a few spots to help add a little more depth to some of the characters. The visual look of the film is commendable. Traditional SW but tweaked just enough to convey a newness to it (examples: storm trooper outfits, TIE fighters, etc)... And now for what's wrong with this movie!! Large holes in character background. While this seems to be a big source of complaint from fans, especially because it lends to unexplained inconsistencies in some of the major characters. Everyone should try and chill out!! Some of this will be covered in the next movie (probably). Some of it will be revealed in the commercial empire of the SW after market (in such things as toys, games, collectors cards, and possibly TV shows & cartoons). We will have to wait and see if it covers all the significant inconsistencies... Having said that, the sheer volume of it is annoying!! More than any other SW movie. Next issue: disappointing performances by the old cast. Han is Han! One of the strongpoints of the film. Leia, at times seems like she's coming down off a hangover, but at other times gives a convincing performance. Even Chewbacca gives a deadpan performance at one important point in the movie.The villain, Kylo Ren, while not being a big disappointment, is a mixed bag. The biggest flaw by far is the plot. The plot is heavily, heavily, heavily recycled!! So much so that it can't be overstated! (Hence the title of this review)! Hopefully the next SW will fix some of the character background issues. But unless they correct the totally unoriginal plot... then, just like in this movie... great visual effects, a great pace, and somewhat compelling characters will not be enough to make up for it.
ID_100385;8;10;This movie was amazing it is the perfect follow up to the original trilogy. the writing and acting was perfect along with the special effects. it is great to see old characters return as well as meet brand new characters. this movie is a must for true Star Wars fans.
ID_100386;10;10;"I will not spoil anything, don't worry! I've been a fan since 1977,when I saw the original Star Wars with my dad at a cinema theater (exactly where I actually 20 years later would eat lunch with David Prowse...but that's another story!). It changed me from a 7-year old kid to a 7-year old film fan! And, for sentimental and nostalgic reason, nothing can be compared to the original trilogy (1977-1983) if you ask me! Still, I ""kind of"" like the prequel trilogy (1999-2005), even if it can't be compared to the original ones. Maybe a generation thing but they lacked ""fascination"".BUT the new sequel trilogy is on a whole different level! It IS really good! Damn good!!! Why? Because the script has ""feeling"", it introduces new characters that I care for - and that is the most important thing! It's a great script - told with speed like a roller-coaster but JJ Abrams is never forgetting the drama! It's not easy (duuh!) to fulfill all our fan dreams, it's impossible, but hell this is making me long already for the next Episode 8! You understand when you've seen it! Harrison Ford is my favorite actor of all time, actually since 1977 when I first saw Han Solo in action chasing those stormtroopers...so of course it's great to see him return to that galaxy far away a long ago! THAT alone got me SO excited! Hell, the whole planet loves Harrison Ford as Han Solo! He is still going strong, making me wish and hope for INDY 5! Harrison Ford delivers a surprisingly new depth to the saga, he is just great and give the aging Han Solo more ""weight"" (no, he is still in good shape dammit, but you know what I mean!)...but as we all (should) understand this new sequel trilogy is not about the old characters, they are just the link to the new ones. I understand that. Everyone watching it, with certain nostalgic expectations, MUST understand that! Because, seriously,the new star of the Star Wars Saga is the (lovely!) Rey!!! She is just awesome!!! Really really AWESOME!!! I can't believe it, she is the best, most well written female action hero ever!!! Yes! I kid you not. She is interesting and kicking ass! The beautiful and charismatic Daisy Ridley is a new favorite, a new star is born for sure! Hmm. It's night here in Sweden. And I realize now, as I write this about 14 hours after I've seen it here in Sweden, that it's just too much to talk about. So...if anyone is skeptical, just go and see it! I will actually see it again tomorrow - take that as a hint! ;)It's 10/10 for sure! The best film of the year for sure! A worthy sequel for sure! AND best of all, it makes me really honestly ""feel something"" again for this beloved saga, for the first time since 1983!So, yes, the force is wide awake again!!! Gotta love it! :)"
ID_100388;9;10;"The first line in this movie is ""This will begin to make things right."" I feel like that's a jab at the prequels. ""Hey, we know the prequels were awful, but this new movie will begin to make things right."" Probably not intentional, but clever nonetheless. My goodness, this movie is so well done! The parallels and metaphors are so cleverly written. Even if you haven't seen any Star Wars movies before, you can watch this as a standalone. Will you get more out of it if you've seen the original trilogy? Of course. Is it essential viewing before going into this one? No. The plot does at times feel ""Been there, seen that,"" because it is essentially a remake of A New Hope. However, there's enough new bits in the story that left me satisfied. The practical effects are so well done, and the very little CGI in the movie looks more realistic than the prequels ever did. There's an important message in the movie, and the characters are relatable. Unlike some of the characters in the prequels, you care about what happens to these new characters. They're acting is great, and the classic actors still feel like their characters. Harrison Ford is still great with the zingers, and C-3PO is still the worrisome robot we all love. J. J. Abrams has restored what we all love about Star Wars. Even before the classic characters show up, it still feels like a Star Wars movie. If the upcoming films are even 1/4 as good as this was, there's a new hope for the Star Wars franchise.
Grade: A- 9/10 4/5 stars"
ID_100390;6;9;This post doesn't contain spoilers.I always valued a good story and character development more than all the rest. The previous movies were not perfect, but I become fond of them in a way. Today I witnessed how money is once again the only thing that matters.Before I even saw the movie I predicted 70% of the story, which is a truly disturbing fact. Cheap jokes and all the unnecessary dialogs were turning the movie second by second into uninteresting and boring adaptation of the previous series. Harrison Jones is a great actor, but his time in Star Wars is over. Time to move on, focus on new heroes, tell us how they feel deep inside, picture their emotions and actions from a different side of view, not just Disney fairy tale, we had enough of this already.I tried to like it, I truly did, but it is too shallow, too simple... As a mediocre star wars fan, going on a midnight premiere in a helm of Kylo Ren, I am disappointed.
ID_100391;3;5;I've seen a discrepancy between the grade of 8.4 and the mass of bad reviews but still decided to go and watch it. Should have donated to wikipedia instead. Just trust those who tell it feels like a weak remake. There are almost no new ideas here just the same rehash of the good ideas and visually very similar shots from the first two films which becomes now a cliché. Bad father - good son or vice versa, death star but bigger, scenes in an alien pub, scenes in the desert, scenes in the mountain terrain with snow. Lots of explosions and flying, special effects OK as usual. Very few jokes, one or two good ones. The acting is wooden. All the gender, race issues checked in but with weak acting do not look believable. There is something fishy with the 8.4 grade, even assuming the wave of fans. Mechanical turk?
ID_100392;10;8;Just from a packed first showing @ 12:01 am in Exeter, UK of Star Wars: The Force Awakens (in 3D). Remarkably I saw the first in 1977 on a first showing, and subsequent ones in between.Probably makes me a geek & definitely a Star Wars fan, however I did go to this viewing with some trepidation. New director, main characters, different studio.... could they keep it fresh and maintain the well worked recipe of success the previous six, George Lucas had conjured up?The answer is J. J. Abrams & crew produced a total success,obviously created with love and affection of watching previous versions. Great story with continuity of the Star Wars saga, new graphics / CGI, but with a perfect blend of old characters with new, yet the familiar Star Wars places and technology.A must see on the big screen, especially in 3d, for young and old whether a fan of the previous films or not. I can guarantee no one will be bored. Thanks Disney, and will book for a first showing for the follow up. Next year?
ID_100394;8;10;The Force Awakens successfully revived Star Wars for many people. It made it good again by capitalizing on things we enjoy from a Star Wars movie. The story is a little similar to A New Hope, however it still has many creative twists and leaves you on a cliffhanger that left fans restless. All the music, acting and effects are incredible. The Force Awakens will always be a top tier Star Wars movie.
ID_100395;10;10;"A new empire rose. A young man fell to the Dark Side. A Stormtrooper rebelled. The Force awakened in a young hero. Lightsabers ignited. An old Jedi Master removed his hood.In 2015, these images were enthralling to see. A sweet summer child I was back then, and visions danced through my head of what wonders the new generation of Star Wars would bring us next.Alas, I am writing this from 2020. I am a man now. A man who has witnessed the horrors that this new generation of Star Wars actually wrought. It's genuinely hard for me to revisit ""The Force Awakens"" now, for the express purpose that I actually really enjoy it. It's certainly the strongest movie of the sequel trilogy. There's a certain irony to this, as it is brazenly and unabashedly the same movie as ""Star Wars: A New Hope"" with a new coat of paint.Back in 2015, this was somehow its strongest suit and its greatest flaw simultaneously. It was just so exhilarating to be back in this universe, and for the forefront of the universe to once again be its wild adventures and scrappy underdog sensibilities. It was fun to see a new cast of likable characters come together and learn about the universe as they learned about themselves.The beat-for-beat aping of a previous story in the same franchise was excusable at the time, because director JJ Abrams sprinkled in just enough seeds of intrigue to promise us that the direction would start to veer into its own unique story. Now that the promise has turned up empty, the derivativeness certainly doesn't do itself any favors anymore.So how is one meant to judge something that's only part of a whole? How is one meant to view an enjoyable movie when that movie only tells part of the story, and the rest of the story doesn't live up? I don't know the answers to these questions. I just know I'll be watching the original trilogy instead."
ID_100396;10;10;This is the best movie in the Star Wars series so far. It was truly a chill through out. It was a knockout. It is a great movie without using profanity and sexual content. All Star Wars fans will love this movie. This movie was a movie that will be remembered for a long time as the best movie ever. I have never seen anything like this before it was so incredible. You will have to see it to believe it.The Force Awakens is truly the greatest movie ever created it was flawless. Take your whole family to see this once in a life time movie that will change their lives forever. It is stupendous. The acting was great especially Harrison Ford that guy can act he is one of the best actors ever.Thank you for readingMay the force be with you
ID_100398;9;10;I don't understand why people say this is a cheap copy of A New Hope. Please The Phantom Menace had more similarities to A New Hope than Force Awakens. Did it have some similarities? Sure! The biggest one was the weapon they had, The Starkiller Base. But that's it. This movie left you wanting more! Like you wished that the movie wouldn't end! I feel like that is the only Star Wars movie in the entire saga to have that feeling!
ID_100399;8;9;"I don't need to explain what this movie is; everyone knows what Star Wars is, we all know there were three good ones and then there were three not-so-good ones. It's no secret that this movie is the most important film of the year to a lot of people...so what did I think?I'll star off with what I enjoyed, which was a lot. I always love a J.J. Abrams film and so I enjoyed seeing his directing now in this Universe. He gives you some absolutely amazing shots showing you this fantastic world and it's characters, a highlight for me being the opening scenes. He also does action pieces well, and a few times I could see things reminiscent of 2009's Star Trek; so on a directing front I can't think of anyone else who could've done it. In a similar vein to that, I love the use of practical effects in this; the film of course had CGI and used it well but I always smiled when seeing what I knew was really there, weather it be some alien bird pecking away or a monstrous thug lounging in a bar, it really worked well. Script-wise was not bad at all. I think they did humour pretty well, I definitely laughed out loud at scenes, maybe for me personally one or two didn't land as much but as a whole it's entertaining on that front. The drama as well was done excellently; you really fell in love with these characters and were invested in their lives, including even the little BB-8 droid and Oscar Isaac's cool-guy pilot character, which added to the emotional beats and shocks of the plot. A high point for me was the Finn and Poe friendship that had very short screen-time but in those moments you could see these guys were bros.Just mentioning the cast quickly, Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher did great jobs reprising their roles, couldn't fault them really and they jelled so well with the new guys, Daisy Ridley and John Boyega who were phenomenal and can definitely see them having future careers. I loved their characters and am looking forward to seeing them again. Mark Hamill was also in this film and all I'm going to say is that I enjoyed every moment he was on screen.Now for some things I didn't enjoy as much. Don't get me wrong, The Force Awakens is definitely it's own thing and gives us places and concepts we've not seen before but unfortunately it did slip into a similar problem Jurassic World had which was that it just recreated too many moments and plot points from it's predecessors. Scenes were happening where I was thinking ""Really? We're doing this again?"" and that was it's main weakness for me, too much of what we'd already had and so it made it predictable in or or two places. Another point that I'd like to mention, that may only be something I feel, but the climax didn't seem very....climactic. It wasn't until we were in the middle of a scene and I thought about how long it had already been on that I realised I was watching the final battle, as it were. It was fine in itself, definitely some tense and action packed moments but I think due to the fact that the movie was constantly fast paced it didn't transition well that this was now something big.In the end Star Wars: The Force Awakens is a fantastic movie and entertaining on it's own, it gives some exciting references and cameos for the long-term fans but if you're not a casual viewer then you may feel it's retreading some familiar ground."
ID_100400;6;8;"When the first part of Star Wars (now referred to as Episode IV) came to the movie theaters back in the late 1970ies, George Lucas, the creator, rather went on holiday with his buddy Steven Spielberg than attending the premiere of his movie expecting this B-movie inspired Sci-FI Western to be a failure and yet it became possibly the most successful movie franchise in history giving millions of viewers worldwide a form of light escapism which rarely another series managed to accomplish; and now roughly 40 years later, we have a whole different situation, the movie companies invested so much money into this and the fan expectations are so high that failure is simply not an option so whatever fresh, innovative, bold ideas on part of young, aspiring script authors were submitted for Episode VII, obviously everything was abandoned as too risky for a potential success, therefore they hired the same old script author L. Kasdan not to adequately continue the saga but to simply retell it for a new generation of movie goers in such a way that the old fans won't feel excluded and J.J. Abrams made sure the cast is young and energetic and the dialogues not so cheesy like in G. Lukas' times.The result is a fastidious clinging to main plot lines of Episode IV our heroes have to pass in order to be more or less at the same endpoint as their predecessors. Making the new version of Luke Skywalker female is not hiding how closely she is portrayed after Luke having no real background story whatsoever leaving much to tell for further installments emphasizing the incomplete nature of Episode VII. As much as Kylo would like to become the new Darth Vader, in the end he is just a whiny mother's boy, such a disappointment. The fact alone that they felt the need for a Darth Vader rip-off is a sacrilege in my eyes, instead it would have been more honest to just let Vader clone or resurrect otherwise than just replace him with a wannabe cult figure. Some of the CGI aliens look like they come right from Hogwarts. J. Boyega as Finn is the only new archetype of character having no old role model. And the new version of R2D2, the cute BB-8 is almost stealing the show to everyone and he is just a beeping ball with a head! All the old characters like Han Solo or C3PO seemingly pop up out of nothing and they are really holding the story kept into a firm nostalgia corsage. Especially this entire annoying relational entanglements in the sense of who is the grandfather or mother or cousin of whom is on very trivial dramedy level. Where the prequels used to be all shiny and imaginative and epic in terms of settings and abundance, Episode VII is just open, barren deserts, empty space and forsaken forests, gray and monotonous with cheap scenery and one or two solid space battles and a weak melee fight.I really liked the beginning of this movie up until I realized this dog is just chasing after his own tail and we even applaud it since failure is not an option."
ID_100401;4;9;"First of, the good. The universe is very true to what we've appreciated in the mention-worthy movies of the series. It's convincing and authentic. The atmosphere is spot on.But the entire movie feels underwhelming: all the focus around a girl and a black dude. While other cameo appearances come into view, of people die where we should care about and feel outraged about. But we know them so briefly, we don't care yet enough or aren't invested enough to be outraged.Planet blown up ? Yes. Outraged? No, who were these people? Oh flash. It's over. Emotional tormented guy, who is he? For a moment I hoped the girl would be brought in front of the ""huge evil force"". Look at this strange looking rebel. Look at him again. He's at it. He's gone. Who was he? We don't care. Half the rebel fighters are gone! oh no! I mean, whatever. The girl is still hanging on a wall ? How did Han solo get up there when there was just 30 seconds left ?And what about the ""these aren't the droids you're looking for"" scene? That was... beyond silly and lame.The best thing in the movie is to see Harrison Ford again play and get back into the Star Wars universe. It's very well done.But, before you know it, you realize you are revisiting old scenes and even the same scenario's. Add to this visiting old characters and you feel sortof dragged around this disoriented girl and black dude being confused and not understanding what is going on. But becoming the ""superhero antagonist"" without even doing effort for it ? Guess this is 2016. It lacks the sérieux and sense of dedication of the persona's. Even sense of urgency or danger. Maybe it was the script? The actors ?"
ID_100402;8;2;"No other movie this year, or perhaps ever, has been surrounded with as much hype as this long-awaited sequel set a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away. With lofty expectations and overly protective fans demanding the world, J.J. Abrams must walk a tightrope in returning this beloved franchise to the big screen for both decade-old fanatics and a new generation of devotees. It's not the first time Abrams has tasked himself with the impossible – after delivering the superb Star Trek reboot in 2009 – and he very nearly achieves it again here, albeit falling short of the ""classic"" status so many will be hoping for. He, and everyone else, will just have to settle for a damn fine fantasy flick that should be enjoyed on its own terms.Focussing on the resourceful scavenger Rey (impressive newcomer Daisy Ridley) as she teams up with ex-Storm Trooper Finn (equally wonderful John Boyega), this instalment capitalises on the exuberance of its fresh faces without forgetting its past. Of the original stars it's Han Solo and Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew) who feature most prominently, the former played with nonchalant arrogance by Harrison Ford and the latter providing a few laughs here and there. In fact humour seems to be a priority for this episode, with plenty of laugh-out-loud moments littered throughout – mischievous soccer ball droid BB8 is sure to be a hit amongst the younger viewers – and an overall tone that is playful without being childish. Although there's nothing playful about villain Kylo Ren. Conceptually striking and portrayed with sinister gravitas by Adam Driver, Kylo Ren is a formidable foe worthy of filling Vader's shoes as the series' antagonist. Elsewhere Oscar Isaac is charismatic as Resistance (the good guys) pilot Poe Dameron, Domhnall Gleeson is a misfire as First Order (the bad guys) leader General Hux, Gwendoline Christie is a disappointing non-event as Captain Phasma and Carrie Fisher brings nostalgic power as General Leia.Visually there's not a flaw to be found, Abrams opting for practical effects over CGI where possible, harking back to the on-location tangibility of the original trilogy instead of the fake sheen of the empty prequels. That's not to say there's an absence of aerial action though: the Millennium Falcon's introductory flight is a rickety blast, a Tie Fighter escape sequence is exhilarating (and highly amusing) and the climactic outer space showdown is suitably grand. The light sabre battles are also decidedly old school, Abrams infusing them with an emotional rough-around-the-edges feel similar to those between Luke and Vader in episodes 4 and 5, rather than the heavily stylised duels of the prequels. The film's shortfalls primarily come from a less-than-perfect screenplay (by Abrams, Michael Arndt and Lawrence Kasdan), with a few missed opportunities with short-lived characters and a surprisingly substantial amount of plot holes and contrivances being allowed through to the final cut.An immensely entertaining blockbuster that doesn't transcend the fantasy genre like a couple of its predecessors, The Force Awakens is a satisfying large-scale space saga that sates the appetite until the next Star Wars entry."
ID_100403;9;3;"Star Wars! These two words are all I need to say when describing what is probably the most iconic cinema story of all time. I've never said it was the greatest (some may argue that though), it's responsible for reinvigorating the science fiction genre, raising the stakes on blockbusters, and turning a man with a creative vision into one of the biggest leaders in Hollywood. Star Wars has transcended upon generation after generation, letting children and their grandparents relive the tale of a warrior's journey through the combination of several likable characters and amazing special effects. This original series became of one cinema's greatest treasuresuntil the prequels.Three movies were never enough, so a whole galaxy of merchandising and novels had to fill the gap for fans that wanted more. It wasn't until 1999 when creator George Lucas returned to the galaxy far, far away to give us three more movies that gave us information on how the events in Star Wars came to be. I don't think the prequel saga is as bad as most people say it is, but I can agree that it was no where as entertaining as the original trilogy. Now under the mind of J.J. Abrams, the battle continues in Star Wars: The Force Awakens. It's revealed that sometime after the events of Return of the Jedi, Luke Skywalker has left and has been missing for years and that though the Galactic Empire was weakened after the death of Darth Vader and the Emperor, it didn't end the war by a long shot.The First Order is searching for Luke as is the Resistance. The key seems to be within a ball-like droid, BB-8 whose owner is the best resistance pilot, Poe Dameron (played by Oscar Isaac). BB-8 manages to escape before Poe is taken away by commander of the First Order, Kylo Ren (played by Adam Driver).BB-8 is found by junk scavenger Rey (played by Daisy Ridley) who also bumps into Finn (played by John Boyega), a Stormtropper who goes rouge after seeing the horrors of the First Order. The two and BB-8 manage to get away from a First Order attack after acquiring the Millennium Falcon from the previous movies. Along the way, they come across Han Solo (played by Harrison Ford), Chewbacca, Leia (played by Carrie Fischer) and more as the resistance takes another stance to try to find Luke (played by Mark Hamil) and battle the First Order. Much of the hype driving this movie is that not only is it a long awaited sequel to such an iconic franchise, but also that J.J. Abrams is taking over George Lucas. The Force Awakens not only reminded me why I love Star Wars, but made me excited by the possibility of seeing another one soon. The result is a fantastic, exciting movie that boasts a ton of great things.The casting is perfect as the older crew fits into their old shoes just as well, especially Harrison Ford who seems more at ease here then he was in the last Indiana Jones. The newcomers like Adam Driver, Oscar Isaac, and John Boyega have no problem setting themselves up as new likable characters that should set into the Star Wars saga without a problem. The gold star here goes to Daisy Ridley who this movie really belongs to. While I won't say why, she is perhaps one of the best new strong female characters (since Charlize Theron in Mad Max: Fury Road).Adding to the show is the special effects which learned it's lesson from the previous movies that it's not digital all the way, but a blend of practical and computer effects that bring it's life back to the good old days of the original trilogy.The story is also really good, taking us on another hero's journey that the Star Wars movies is famous for telling. Though it is familiar, it feels fresh with the way it is written and portrayed. The only problem I had without giving anything away, is that it does feel like it makes too many winks at the original Star Wars movie, following certain beets we've seen before. While not bad, it did manage to remain predictable in some areas. I'll give this nine BB-8's out of ten. I doubt anyone coming in will say that it was bad from beginning to end. The Force Awakens is properly titled, as the folks at Disney and J.J. Abrams have brought back the science fiction magic in such a new and fantastical way that everyone will be glad they saw this. So may the force be with you and longer as the movie should delight you."
ID_100404;8;9;"Let's be honest. After the colossal disappointments of episodes 1-3 ""The Force Awakens"" was bound to be ravenously coveted and widely accepted if it had any glimmer of competency. So, was Episode 7 better than the last three episodes released?? OF COURSE! I don't want to talk about the movie itself, I'd much rather talk about the feel of the movie. Before I talk about the feel of the movie I want to say that John Boyega, Finn, displayed more emotion and more acting range in one scene than the dreadful Hayden Christiansen showed in two movies. That's not fair; EVERY actor showed more range than Hayden did. OK, enough dwelling on the past.""The Force Awakens"" hearkened back to its roots. I had the good ol' feeling I had way back when I used to watch episodes 4-6 over and over again. It had a true authentic feel to it. The feel of the force, the feel of a true rebellion, the feel of a true dark side. Yes, it helped to see some of our old heroes even in their advanced ages. Yes, it helped seeing some of the old machines, old digs, old terrains. Yes, all of that helped, but ultimately everything together helped to restore the superb feeling given by episodes 4-6."
ID_100405;6;10;"""This will begin to make things right,"" are the first words you hear in this seventh episode of the ""Star Wars"" saga. For all intents and purposes that's a promise made not just by co-writer and director J.J. Abrams, but also by the folks at The Disney Corporation who recently spent billions of dollars to purchase this galaxy far, far away. No more will we have to hear about trade routes, taxation disputes, nor any of those tedious Jedi council meetings. The mortification of George Lucas's widely-despised prequels will soon be lost to the sands of time alongside his Crystal Skulls, Jar-Jar Binks, and Hayden Christensen.STAR WARS EPISODE VII: THE FORCE AWAKENS is the ""Star Wars"" movie you think you've been waiting for. It's everything you've ever wanted from one of these pictures, and also a heck of a lot less. A lean, mean nostalgia-dispensing machine, the movie is designed to ring bells and elbow you in the ribs with familiar sights and faces constantly as it hurtles from scene to scene at a breakneck pace. It's sleekly engineered to be the kind of film you point at and nod in appreciation–because you remember ""Star Wars,"" and those memories are quite fond. Abrams gets the tricky tone and jokey exhilaration down pat, the feeling of (re)visiting a rusted-out, slightly sarcastic fairy tale. Still, a few hours after the credits rolled it's all evaporating and I'm struggling to recall a remotely original or inventive moment in the entire goddamn thing.After the departure of ""Toy Story 3"" scribe Michael Arndt, Abrams enlisted Lawrence Kasdan, who wrote the best (""The Empire Strikes Back"") and the worst (""Return of the Jedi"") films in the original trilogy for this mix-tape mashup of the series' Greatest Hits: A pure-of-heart, resourceful young nobody from a barren desert planet just so happens upon an adorable droid containing information that's vital to the rebel army currently battling a fascist intergalactic empire. The Force is strong with this kid, leading to misadventures across the stars with a chaste love interest, a cocky space jockey, and a kindly old mentor who knows more than he's letting on, all aboard a ramshackle smuggling ship with a fuzzy co-pilot. There's a tall, scary dude in a mask with a long black cloak toting a red lightsaber taking orders from an even creepier grotesque on a throne. Eventually we're surprised to find out that somebody unexpected is somebody else's father, and the villains have once again constructed a gigantic battle station capable of destroying entire planets that can still somehow be blown up by X-Wing Fighters flying wicked fast through narrow steel canyons.But there are people to enjoy on this over-familiar trip. I most liked Daisy Ridley's take-no-guff heroine, Rey, flummoxed by the men who keep attempting to rescue her while she can handle herself just fine, thank you very much. (""Why do you keep grabbing my hand when we run?"" becomes an early recurring gag.) I was also fond of John Boyega's Finn, a reluctant Stormtrooper who abandons his post and joins the Resistance, kicking up a few questions of morality the rest of this film would rather not address during the routine mass slaughters. Oscar Isaac pops in for a scant handful of scenes to be ridiculously dashing and movie star-ish, hopefully securing a larger role in the next six-hundred sequels.And then there's that old rapscallion space-smuggler Han Solo, earning every bit of the thunderous ovation with which the audience inevitably greets his return. Harrison Ford hasn't been this delightful in decades, clumsily wise-cracking once again with his shaggy grey hair, deferring to his seven-foot sidekick, Chewie. (Comparing Ford's eye-rolling non-performance in ""Return of the Jedi"" to his work here is like night and day. Maybe it was the dump-truck full of Disney money but I can't remember the last time I've seen him so invested in a role.) We even get a couple of too-short scenes in which Han bickers once again with Carrie Fisher's General Leia. Forget whatever's awakening, I'd pay twice as much to watch a movie about their divorce.That's another big problem with ""The Force Awakens."" It's in an awful hurry to get nowhere new. Abrams apes Lucas' old-timey screen-wipes from side to side, often knocking us unto the next scene during a line of dialogue, without even a moment to breathe. Pretty much every character interaction ends with a big blaster shoot-out and a pointless chase sequence that almost never has any bearing on the plot. (I liked these characters so much I'd rather have spent more time with them when they weren't running.) The breathlessness of the pacing turns a monumental death into a throwaway that everyone seems to be miraculously over a whopping two minutes later.It is interesting, I think, to compare the two blockbuster 1970s franchises recently surrendered by their auteurs and taken over by new directors for their seventh installments during this particular holiday season. Ryan Coogler's ""Creed"" reconfigures the ""Rocky"" formula as a question of legacy, embracing old tropes and melodrama while staying very much rooted in questions of race and class in the here and now. The movie is vital, about something in the year 2015, occasionally winking at the past, but also always looking forward.""The Force Awakens"" exists in a rearview mirror. It's a product-launch slash refresher-course designed to remind us all how much we love ""Star Wars,"" introducing enough new and exciting talent to at least leave us hoping–once again–that maybe the next film will finally be the one that lives up to the promise of those first two"
